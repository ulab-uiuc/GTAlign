The hot filament is protected from oxidation with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is prevented by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections. \n\nIncandescent bulbs are much less efficient than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 lumens per watt, compared with 60 lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150 lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared with other types of lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.\n\nPrevious Q&A:\nQ: How is is protected?\nA: with a glass or quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated.\n\nQ: How about in a halogen bulb?\nA: a chemical process\n\nQuestion:\nHow does the bulb get its energy supply?'}]",False,abg-coqa,,,6,abg-coqa,abg-coqa

When he left the hospital, Adam decided to become a doctor, so he went to a medical school in Virginia, USA. But when he was there, he did things in a different way. For example, he didn\'t like the doctor\'s white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn\'t like Adams because he was too different. But Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh When he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called ""the Gusundheit Institute"",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people. Hunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:""hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend.

And we began to walk forward in silence. \n\n""Are ye sorry to leave Essendean?"" said he, after awhile. \n\n""Why, sir,"" said I, ""if I knew where I was going, or what was likely to become of me, I would tell you candidly.

Theories differ, but there\'s no doubt that Napoleon was a major influence. The French had used the right since at least the late 18th century. Some say that before the French Revolution, noblemen drove their carriages on the left, forcing the peasants to the right. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-hand control, like Great Britain, followed their left-hand tradition. \n\nThe U.S. has not always been a nation of right-hand rivers; earlier in its history, carriage and horse traffic traveled on the left, as it did in England. But by the late 1700s, people driving large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses began promoting a shift to the right. A driver would sit on the rear left horse in order to wave his whip with his right hand; to see opposite traffic clearly, they traveled on the right. \n\nOne of the final moves to firmly standardize traffic directions in the U.S. occurred in the 20th century, when Henry Ford decided to mass-produce his cars with controls on the left (one reason, stated in 1908; the convenience for passengers exiting directly onto the edge, especially... if there is a lady to be considered). Once these rules were set, many countries eventually adjusted to the right-hand standard, including Canada in the 1920s, Sweden in 1967 and Burma in 1970. The U.K. and former colonies such as Australia and India are among the western world\'s few remaining holdouts. Several Asian countries, including Japan, use the left as well -- thought many places use both right-hand-drive and left-hand-drive cars.\n\nPrevious Q&A:\nQ: Since when?\nA: at least the late 18th century.\n\nQ: Why do some say the noblemen drove their carriage on the left?\nA: forcing the peasants to the right\n\nQuestion:\nWhere did Napoleon bring right-handed traffic?'}]",False,abg-coqa,,,5,abg-coqa,abg-coqa

For years, he had always been planning to paint a work of art, but had never yet begun it. He earned a little money by serving as a model to artists who could not pay for a professional model. He was a fierce, little, old man who protected the two young women in the studio apartment above him. \n\nSue found Behrman in his room. In one area was a blank canvas that had been waiting twenty-five years for the first line of paint. Sue told him about Johnsy and how she feared that her friend would float away like a leaf on the old ivy vine climbing hopelessly up the outside block wall. \n\nOld Behrman was angered at such an idea. ""Are there people in the world with the foolishness to die because leaves drop off a vine? Why do you let that silly business come in her brain?"" \n\n""She is very sick and weak,"" said Sue, ""and the disease has left her mind full of strange ideas."" \n\n""This is not any place in which one so good as Miss Johnsy shall lie sick,"" yelled Behrman. ""Some day I will paint a masterpiece, and we shall all go away."" \n\nJohnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs. Sue pulled the shade down to cover the window. She and Behrman went into the other room. They looked out a window fearfully at the ivy vine. Then they looked at each other without speaking. A cold rain was falling, mixed with snow. \n\nThe next morning, Sue awoke after an hour\'s sleep. She found Johnsy with wide-open eyes staring at the covered window. ""Pull up the shade; I want to see,"" she ordered, quietly. Sue obeyed. \n\nAfter the beating rain and fierce wind that blew through the night, there yet stood against the wall one ivy leaf. It was the last one on the vine. It was still dark green at the center. But its edges were color1ed with the yellow. It hung bravely from the branch about seven meters above the ground. \n\n""It is the last one,"" said Johnsy. ""I thought it would surely fail during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today and I shall die at the same time."" \n\n""Dear, dear!"" said Sue, leaning her worn face down toward the bed. ""Think of me, if you won\'t think of yourself. What would I do?"" But Johnsy did not answer. \n\nThe next morning, when it was light, Johnsy demanded that the window shade be raised. The ivy leaf was still there. Johnsy lay for a long time, looking at it. And then she called to Sue, who was preparing chicken soup. \n\n""I\'ve been a bad girl,"" said Johnsy. ""Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how bad I was. It is wrong to want to die. You may bring me a little soup now."" \n\nAn hour later she said: ""someday I hope to paint the Bay of Naples."" \n\nLater in the day, the doctor came, and Sue talked to him in the hallway. ""Even chances. With good care, you\'ll win,"" said the doctor. ""And now I must see another case I have in your building. Behrman, whose name is some kind of an artist, I believe, has Pneumonia , too. He is an old, weak man and his case is severe. There is no hope for him, but he goes to the hospital today to ease his pain."" \n\nThe next day, the doctor said to Sue:"" She\'s out of danger. You won. Nutrition and care now - that\'s all."" \n\nLater that day, Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, and put one arm around her. ""I have something to tell you, white mouse,"" she said, ""Mister Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was sick only two days. They found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were completely wet and icy cold. They could not imagine where he had been on such a terrible night. \n\n""And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been moved from its place. And art supplies and a painting board with green and yellow color1s mixed on it. \n\n""Look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn\'t you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it is Behrman\'s masterpiece - he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.""\n\nPrevious Q&A:\nQ: What kind of building?\nA: apartment building\n\nQ: Was he a young man?\nA: no\n\nQuestion:\nHow many women lived above him?'}]",False,abg-coqa,,,11,abg-coqa,abg-coqa

It had been placed there since my last visit, and that same day I pushed Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across the landing and round the other room, which, from that day on, became my regular job. \n\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, my sister\'s husband; then I explained my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help. But, she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money - or anything but my daily dinner - nor even mentioned that I should be paid for my services. \n\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she would be seemingly kind to me; sometimes, she would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, ""Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?"" And when I said yes, Miss Havisham would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on Estella\'s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would hold her tightly with great fondness, saying something quietly in her ear that sounded like ""Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!""\n\nPrevious Q&A:\nQ: by who\'s standards?\nA: Miss Havisham\n\nQ: anyone else?\nA: Yes\n\nQuestion:\nwho?'}]",False,abg-coqa,,,11,abg-coqa,abg-coqa

For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. He developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time. \n\nFeynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There\'s Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You\'re Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.\n\nPrevious Q&A:\nQ: What that illustration all about?\nA: behavior of subatomic particles\n\nQ: Did he write any biography?\nA: semi-autobiographical\n\nQuestion:\nWhat title is that?'}]",False,abg-coqa,,,10,abg-coqa,abg-coqa
