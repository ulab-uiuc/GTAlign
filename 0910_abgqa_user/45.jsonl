The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a plan in 1947 that allowed for the use of 7-digit numbers, but it wasn't until the 1950s that the majority of telephone exchanges were upgraded to support this format. However, the exact date of the first 7-digit number being dialed is not definitively known, as it varied by region and the specific exchange. The 7-digit format was eventually replaced by the 10-digit format in the 1960s and 1970s, which included a three-digit area code.\", \"followup\": \"Is there a particular region or city you are interested in knowing more about?\"}</response>", "gts": "multipleQAs###There are multiple meanings of the question.Meaning 0: When cities start to upgrade to the 7 digit format that included letters and numbers?; Answer 0: 1947 to 1951\nMeaning 1: When did the 7 digit all number telephone number format start?; Answer 1: 1960 to 1981\n", "score": 0.7751500920022025, "step": 45, "reward": 0.7751501202583313, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.7751500920022025, "llm_reward": 0.5304104175400619, "utility": 0.6412079880624583, "reward_gap": 0.24473967446214062, "source": "ambig_qa"}

The constant \\(\\pi\\) (pi) represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, which is approximately 3.14159. The formula for the area was derived by considering the circle as a collection of infinitesimally small rings, and then summing up their areas. This process, known as integration, led to the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). However, the exact historical derivation can be complex and involves calculus.
