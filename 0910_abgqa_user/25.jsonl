Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences).

Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success.
