Here’s a draft for your article:\n\n---\n\n**Crypto Industry Expectations for 2022: Web3, Metaverse, DeFi, and NFTs**\n\nAs we look ahead to 2022, the crypto industry is poised for significant growth and transformation. Web3, the metaverse, decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are expected to play pivotal roles in shaping the future of digital assets. This article will explore these trends and provide investment advice for crypto investors.\n\n**Web3: The Future of the Internet**\n\nWeb3, also known as the decentralized web, aims to create a more secure, transparent, and user-centric internet. Projects like Ethereum 2.0 (L2) are working to improve scalability and reduce transaction times. Web3 platforms are expected to foster innovation and collaboration among developers, enabling the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and services.\n\n**Metaverse: Virtual Realities and Beyond**\n\nThe metaverse, a shared virtual space where users can interact and engage in various activities, is gaining momentum. Companies like Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft are investing heavily in metaverse technologies. As the metaverse evolves, it will likely become a key platform for social interaction, entertainment, and commerce. Investors should consider the potential for metaverse-related companies to drive growth in the crypto space.\n\n**DeFi: Decentralized Finance**\n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) has already disrupted traditional financial services, offering users access to lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. The DeFi ecosystem is expected to continue expanding, with new protocols and platforms emerging. Investors should focus on fundamental analysis and risk management, as DeFi projects can be highly volatile.\n\n**NFTs: Beyond Art**\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) have gained popularity beyond the art world, with applications in gaming, collectibles, and virtual real estate. NFTs provide a unique way to authenticate and track ownership of digital assets. As the NFT market matures, investors should consider the long-term potential of NFTs in various sectors.\n\n**Investment Advice**\n\nIn 2022, investors should prioritize capital protection and fundamental analysis. Web3, metaverse, DeFi, and NFTs are all areas of significant growth, but they also come with risks. Here are some tips for crypto investors:\n\n1. **Diversify Your Portfolio**: Spread your investments across different sectors and projects to mitigate risk.\n2. **Stay Informed**: Keep up with the latest developments in the crypto space and stay informed about regulatory changes.\n3. **Fundamental Analysis**: Focus on the underlying technology and business models of projects you invest in.\n4. **Risk Management**: Be prepared to take losses and have a plan for managing risk.\n\n---\n\n**WAGMI (We Are Going to Make It!)**\n\n---\n\nFeel free to add any additional details or feedback to refine the article further.\n</response>", "gts": "There is this expectation in the crypto space next year. There has been a lot things happening in this space this year. Talking about NFT, web3, metaverse, defi adoption, gamefi, and the rest. Well, some concepts have been there while others resurface this year. However, the big expectation for next year happens to be web3, defi-2, metaverse, gamefi, and L2. Worthy of note is that, these sectors still have a lot of improvement to do. Talking about metaverse, nobody actually knows the true shape of it. Different companies have different speculations and approaches to building it. Truth be told, metaverse, web3, and defi-2 all have their own drawbacks. Some companies championing these sectors might not be there in the next 5–10 years. Companies that will come up in the future will leverage on the mistakes of those in the past to build. That is why, as an investor, your most important assignment is the protection of your capital. You must make your own research so you don’t put your money in a project that won’t succeed.\n\nHowever, there is also a great potential in these projects, especially, now that they are still very young. Common rule of investment in this space is to go where the money is. You only have one thing to do, and that is to follow the smart money. Don’t go against the tide, else, you will be consumed. That’s why you must not joke with fundamental analysis. This analysis shows you where the money is going to and you are just to follow.\n\nFinally, always remember that this space is still very much new. Like a wise man would say, don’t commit your money in a craft that you don’t understand. Make sure you learn and always keep learning.

One of the key benefits is the support for customer self-service, such as FAQs and online forums. These features help customers find answers to their queries independently, which not only improves their experience but also reduces the support load on customer service teams.\n\n**Supporting Customer Self-Service**\n\nCRM systems often include robust support for customer self-service. This can be achieved through FAQs, which are pre-written answers to common questions, and online forums where customers can post and respond to questions. These features are beneficial because:\n\n- **Efficiency**: Customers can quickly find answers to their queries, reducing the need for customer service intervention.\n- **Cost Reduction**: By handling a higher volume of simple inquiries, customer service teams can focus on more complex issues, leading to cost savings.\n- **Customer Satisfaction**: Self-service options can enhance customer satisfaction by providing immediate access to information.\n\n**Reducing Support Load**\n\nBy integrating self-service options into CRM systems, customer service teams can focus on more critical tasks. This shift in focus allows teams to handle more complex issues, leading to a more efficient and effective service delivery. Additionally, self-service tools can help reduce the volume of inquiries, thereby easing the workload on customer service representatives.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure.

Here’s a concise article about the global OTC analgesic market:\n\n**Global OTC Analgesic Market Overview**\nThe global over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic market has seen steady growth, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.61% over the past five years. Topical analgesics have driven significant sales growth, contributing to an 18% boost in market sales. Key demographic factors, such as the growing geriatric population, supported by data from the Kline report and US Census data, have also influenced market trends.\n\nFor more detailed insights, consider exploring the full report for comprehensive analysis.\n\nWould you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of the market?\n</response>", "gts": "The global oral OTC analgesics market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 4.61% during the forecast period, 2019–2028. The growth of the market is attributed to the increasing demand for topical analgesics.\n\nAnalgesics are the counter pain drugs which support in regulating a pain until and unless it is completely eliminated. OTC analgesic drugs are used by people without any need of prescription. Analgesics which do not require doctor’s prescription are classified as OTC analgesics. OTC analgesics are available in brand and generic preparations as tablets, capsules, creams, sprays, and patches. These OTC analgesics constitute three active ingredients namely paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin.\n\nParacetamol is a most commonly used OTC analgesic. Its analgesic property is similar to that of aspirin and ibuprofen. It does not carry any anti-inflammatory effects. Paracetamol prevents prostaglandin synthesis within the central nervous system. It is the first choice of analgesic for pain management. Common side-effects associated with paracetamol are hypersensitivity, rare cases of blood dyscrasias (including thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis). Aspirin is another common OTC analgesic. It is analgesic, antipyretic, antiplatelet, and anti-inflammatory. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase results in analgesic effect of aspirin. Incompatible effects of aspirin are epigastric pain, gastrointestinal ulceration, nausea and vomiting, hypersensitivity, and gout.\n\nMarket Drivers\n\nIncreasing demand of topical analgesics, which are available as pain-relieving creams, lotions, rubs, gels, and sprays, has increased the sales of analgesics by 18 percent. According to Kline Non-prescription Drugs US report, increasing geriatric population worldwide, will generate the demand for pain relief products. According to the US Census Bureau, between 2012 and 2050, the United States will experience considerable growth in its older population. Thus, the growth in geriatric population is driving the growth of the global OTC analgesics market.\n\nAdditionally, the cost efficiency of OTC analgesics drugs is also responsible for fuelling the growth of the market.\n\nVisit https://insights10.com/ for more healthcare industry insights.", "score": 0.5175240255934458, "step": 10, "reward": 0.517524003982544, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.15, "user_reward": 0.1705836998304929, "llm_reward": 0.5175240255934458, "utility": 0.2971214617574784, "reward_gap": 0.34694032576295286, "source": "medium"}

Please read to know why. Vijay Balasubramanian Dec 13, 2021·2 min read\n\nI am sure every blogging and social media platform on the web has spoken about this. So it is about time, the actual folks noticed what is going wrong with your Apps.\n\nPhoto by Viktor Avdeev on Unsplash\n\nOLA and Uber taxi drivers in India are taking orders, then speaking to clients and then cancelling rides. Once the rides are cancelled, they are dropping clients at their respective destinations and taking money offline. Why you wonder?\n\nThe simple answer is high commissions from Ola and Uber. Previously it was bad drivers looking to make high numbers with each ride. Right now its only Ola/Uber who’s fueling this problem.\n\nI’ve heard it from all drivers I took in the last 3 months. Most of them requested I cancel and pay them directly. While I refused one, I couldn’t refuse the 2 more due to urgency. But its a telling sign of things if all drivers can feel the pinch.\n\nFunnily enough Ola even has an option to report this saying ‘Driver asked me to cancel the ride and pay offline’. Which shows that Ola is more than aware of this issue. I am not willing to believe that they don’t know why this happens.\n\nDrivers are not angels, I get that. But they do not have to constantly do this if Ola charges them reasonably. A lot of drivers are decent folks looking to make a living. So the ball is right now in OLA/Uber ‘s court. They can solve this permanently if they take reasonable commissions or offer other perks or transfer some of these costs to their customer as subscription fees or something. If they take care of drivers and drivers wont take shortcuts like these.\n\nTill then these ride sharing services are fighting a losing battle.

Here’s a draft for the article on the biggest digital marketing trends for 2021, focusing on real-time customer engagement, content scaling, and AI tools. We’ll prioritize clarity on how these tools directly address pandemic-driven shifts in customer behavior.\n\n**Real-Time Customer Engagement:**\nIn the post-pandemic era, real-time customer engagement has become crucial. Brands must adapt their strategies to keep up with the fast-paced digital environment. AI tools like chatbots and social media listening platforms can help brands stay connected with customers in real-time. For example, chatbots can provide instant responses to customer inquiries, while social media listening tools can monitor customer sentiment and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.\n\n**Content Scaling:**\nContent scaling is another key trend. With the rise of digital channels, brands need to produce and distribute content efficiently. AI tools like content generation and optimization platforms can help automate the process. For instance, AI can generate personalized content based on customer data, ensuring that the right message reaches the right audience at the right time.\n\n**AI Tools:**\nAI tools have revolutionized digital marketing. They can analyze customer behavior, predict trends, and optimize marketing strategies. For example, AI can identify patterns in customer data to predict future behavior, allowing brands to tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. Additionally, AI can automate tasks like email marketing and social media management, freeing up time for more strategic work.\n\nLet me know if this covers the key points and if you need any adjustments.\n</response>", "gts": "Due to the pandemic in the year 2020 -21 the trends in every business, day-to-day activities, purchasing style, and consumer demand has been changed.

These rituals often reflect the values of community, family, and devotion.\n- **Buddhist Monastic Life:** In Buddhism, monastic life is characterized by simplicity and detachment from material possessions. Monks and nuns often wear simple robes to symbolize their commitment to spiritual practice.\n- **Judaism:** Jewish tradition includes a variety of customs and practices, such as the wearing of kippahs (skullcaps) and the observance of kosher dietary laws. These practices are guided by religious texts and community norms.\n\n---\n\n**Middle-Class Paragraph:**\n\nThe middle class often faces a complex interplay of economic aspiration and necessity.

This quote beautifully encapsulates the idea that by sharing our optimism, we can light up the world and improve the health and happiness of those around us.\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy to get caught up in negativity.

Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: This outline is helpful, but can you add a section about the payment currency options (Dollar vs. Naira) and include that friendly closing question I mentioned in the reference? Also, how can I weave in my personal experience (like creating my Business Manager account first) while keeping it under 500 words?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is clear and

Here are the key elements:\n\n1. **Keywords**: Use relevant keywords naturally throughout your content. Include them in titles, headings, meta descriptions, and throughout the body text.\n2. **Meta Tags**: Optimize your meta titles and meta descriptions to include your target keywords. These tags appear in search results and can encourage clicks.\n3. **Content Quality**: Ensure your content is high-quality, informative, and engaging. Search engines reward quality content.\n4. **Internal Linking**: Use internal links to help search engines understand the structure of your site and distribute link equity.\n5. **Image Optimization**: Optimize images with descriptive alt tags and use file names that include keywords.\n\n### Off-Page SEO\nOff-page SEO involves building high-quality backlinks from other websites. Here are the key elements:\n\n1. **Backlinks**: Acquire backlinks from reputable websites in your industry. High-quality backlinks from authoritative sites can significantly improve your search engine rankings.\n2. **Social Media**: Promote your content on social media platforms to increase visibility and drive traffic back to your site.\n3. **Guest Blogging**: Write guest posts for other websites in your industry. This can help you build backlinks and increase your visibility.\n4. **Content Marketing**: Create valuable content that others want to share. This can help you build backlinks and drive traffic to your site.\n\n### Organic vs. Paid Ads\nOrganic search results are the result of natural search engine rankings. They are free and can provide long-term benefits. Paid ads, on the other hand, are advertisements that appear in search results and are paid for by the advertiser. While they can provide immediate visibility, they are not as sustainable as organic results.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you need any specific examples or additional details.\n</response>", "gts": "SEO Stands for Search Engine Optimization. Search engine optimization is the method involved with finding a way ways to help a site or piece of content position higher on Google.\n\nSearch Engine Optimization(SEO)\n\nThe vital contrast among SEO and paid publicizing is that SEO includes “organic” positioning(Organic Search Engine Optimization), which implies you don’t pay to be in that space. To make it somewhat less complex, website streamlining implies taking a piece of online content and upgrading it so web indexes like Google show it towards the highest point of the page when somebody looks for something.\n\nTake a gander at it thusly. At the point when somebody types “veggie lover lasagna” into Google, they’re probably searching for a formula, fixings, and directions on the best way to make it. If you composed an article about making vegetarian lasagna, you’d need individuals to track down your formula. For anybody to track down it, you want to rank over the wide range of various sites with plans for vegetarian lasagna. It’s difficult, at that point you may have to hire Search Engine Optimization Specialist and that is the thing that SEO is about.\n\nCore Elements of SEO: On-Page SEO and Off-Page SEO\n\nWith regards to more extensive SEO, there are two similarly significant ways: on-page SEO and off-page SEO.\n\nOn-page SEO is tied in with building content to work on your rankings. This comes down to joining keywords into your pages and content, composing great content consistently, ensuring your meta tags and titles are keywords rich and elegantly composed, among different variables.\n\nOff-page SEO is simply the improvement occurring off of your site itself, for example, procuring backlinks. This piece of the situation includes building connections and making content individuals need to share.

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Hey, I need help writing an article comparing cloud hosting and traditional web hosting. Focus on why cloud is better, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you help outline the key points?Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: The case study example should use the real JachOOs company as described in the reference, not a fictional startup.

They call themselves the world’s first autonomous restaurant. Customers order on a self order terminal which allows them to customise the exact toppings of the pizza. The robot arms then prepare the dough, add the sauce and toppings, put the pizza in the oven and cut it in front of your eyes. If you also ordered a drink you’ll get that from a vending machine. Opinion: Pazzi is an excitable example of how a human task can be automated. There is a large team behind it, so we expect to see more of these restaurants in the near future.\n\nA not even that simple task is automated by a robot arm, fun to watch Pazzi make Pizza!\n\nNews 2.Click & Collect but cool\n\nDelipop launched a pick up location for groceries in cooperation with Carrefour in October. To use its service, customers have to order groceries in Carrefour Drive and set the Delipop store as the pick up location. Customers can pick up their orders the same day if ordered in the morning or next day if ordered later during the day. Customers get an access code to enter the colourful Delipop pick-up store. Opinion: Delipop aggregates orders and thus operates at significant lower cost compared to ultra-fast deliveries. At the same time the fresh and modern designed pick-up stores can keep up with the coolness-factor of Gorillas.\n\nA hip and cool pick-up store for groceries, we hope to see more of these around Europe’s neighbourhoods.\n\nNews 3. “Almost Just Walk Out” but more practical\n\nCarrefour launched their new, first of its kind, autonomous store “Carrefour Flash 10/10” in Paris at the end of November.

The scores for customized collections will be calculated on a per case basis, following the same pattern.\n\nCard score overview\n\nFor example, if you own a Rare card with serial number 7, your card score is 102.

Here is the revised draft:\n\n---\n\nEntrepreneurs often consider various workspaces to meet their needs, but coworking spaces offer unique advantages that can significantly enhance productivity and cost-effectiveness. One of the most compelling reasons to choose a coworking space is the cost savings it provides. Unlike working from home, which requires significant investments in furniture and maintenance, coworking spaces often come with fully furnished and professionally managed environments. This means you can focus on your business without worrying about the upkeep of your workspace.\n\nAnother benefit of coworking spaces is the opportunity to make a professional impression on clients. Being in a shared space can help you establish a professional image and foster networking opportunities. Coworking environments are designed to be collaborative and conducive to productive work, making it easier to meet and connect with other professionals.\n\nTo encourage you to join a coworking space, I would like to offer a short call to action. Consider joining a coworking space today and experience the benefits firsthand. Whether you are just starting your entrepreneurial journey or looking to scale your business, a coworking space can provide the support and resources you need to succeed.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if this meets your expectations or if you have any further suggestions.\n</response>", "gts": "More and more entrepreneurs and remote workers are choosing to join coworking spaces. Beginning your business from home is a cost-effective option, but it can lack the professionalism and growth your business may eventually require.\n\nThere are numerous benefits to joining a coworking community:\n\nBe Part of a Community\n\nWork with like-minded individuals who will encourage you to grow. Even if you work from home, it’s a great way to connect to business owners, leaders, freelancers, start-ups, and entrepreneurs. Find networking opportunities and inspiration from relationships you will build.\n\nWorking alone doesn’t mean you have to be lonely!\n\nFlexibility & Convenience\n\nWork and set your own schedule with a variety of options to fit your needs. Need a conference room once a month? Book it! Need more desks for added team members? Expand to a bigger office space! Are you a parent who needs a quiet space away from kids? Coworking can give you the break you need to get work done!\n\nYou can easily book space for a day or a month at a time. Coworking is a hybrid work model which allows you the flexibility you need to run your business.\n\nInvaluable Tools & Resources\n\nCoworking allows you the opportunity to grow by providing resources you may not otherwise have available to you including:\n\nCost Savings\n\nCoworking will save you money by minimizing your overhead costs. You will only pay for the space you need, not the managed facilities. This can be a huge savings for your business compared to renting a leased office.\n\nWhen using a coworking office, you don’t have to worry about chairs, desks, maintenance costs, or decorating the space. You won’t need to purchase furniture. Outfitting a new office can be very expensive as well as take time and effort.\n\nProfessional Workspace\n\nMake a good impression when meeting with potential clients, interviewing, training, hosting webinars, events, and more.

The assistant strategy should aim to provide a detailed, accurate response without ambiguity. Direct answers are likely sufficient, as the user wants factual information.

The objective of beta testing is to identify security risks by testing the functionality of the smart contract. This will help evaluate the quality of the coding and its efficiency.\n\nSmart contract audits are the first line of defence to safeguard investors’ funds. Quillhash, a leading blockchain code auditing firm, has checked the smart contract code for Unicus.\n\nLaunching a product in beta is knowingly releasing it with possible bugs to users. This enables an enterprise to observe how a product is performing when stretched. A beta launch has been a great way to identify the bugs and thereafter work to resolve them. A sub-par performance of a code during the beta phase helps smooth out the friction before the final version is released.\n\nIn blockchain-based products, beta launch generally comes after a smart contract audit that helps companies avoid potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities. An audit comprises automatic scans as well as expert reviews. Automatic scans via APIs and manual checking of code gives users peace of mind as they know the code is fortified.\n\nUnicus is a one-of-a-kind marketplace for NFTs, resolving the existing pain-points in the ecosystem such as unauthorized NFTs, lack of value transfer across blockchain, and absence of loans against NFTs among others. On Unicus, traders find a cross-chain marketplace that is simple to work on and secure.\n\nAs a one-stop platform facilitating a full range of trading activities, Unicus enables traders play NFTs at their full potential. It has effectively plugged the gaps in the existing NFT marketplace ecosystem. The platform also offers advanced statistical and historical capabilities.\n\nUnicus enables content creators to mint NFTs, add metadata and necessary code to the tokens to attain objectives such as continual payment of royalty to the original creator. Adding metadata is as simple as filling a form.\n\nNative token of the marketplace is U1 with the total supply of 250 million tokens. It is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain followed by Polygon (Matic).\n\nBy June 2022, Unicus plans to launch NFTs for business assets as well.", "score": 0.6861961160836041, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6861960887908936, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.2, "user_reward": 0.1671742917218857, "llm_reward": 0.6861961160836041, "utility": 0.33869506888731843, "reward_gap": 0.5190218243617184, "source": "medium"}

Instead of working to make a living, hustle culture demands people work as a lifestyle. Although kicked off by the advent of the celebrity entrepreneur, it wasn’t soon until the average citizen made the decision that working for a living was, indeed, their actual lifestyle.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of Tesla, famously tweeted that “nobody ever changed the world in 40 hours a week”, suggesting that people would need to work twice as hard in order to reach the upper echelons of success.\n\nThis new breed of entrepreneurs has seemingly enhanced the work ethic usually associated with the gig worker. The thing that separates ‘hustle culture’ from ordinary hard work and long hours can be summed up in one word: passion. Entrepreneurs, gig workers, small business owners, and others make their living by doing what they love every day. This is what keeps people motivated to work in the wee hours of the night or to sacrifice their weekends or other off days. Owning your own business comes with certain responsibilities that may seem like more work to some, but won’t feel the same if you’re the owner.\n\nSmall business owners know that their jobs don’t end once the clock hits 5 o’clock. If you aren’t running business operations into the evenings, you’re thinking about new ways to improve your sales, talking to potential customers and vendors, or looking for ways to cut costs and increase revenue. Regardless of your situation as a business owner, one way to help establish a healthy work ethic is to keep your finances organized and in check. Here is where financial management services can help you achieve your success story.\n\nEspecially for the gig worker, dealing with multiple sources of income is the norm. The same is true about accounts payable, as there is a strong possibility of having various vendors that need to be paid for their services as well. Hustle culture might find you dealing with many vendors and clients over time, so having a centralized platform for financial management can help save time and stress. Services like Chime.com, Bill.com or Metaprise — Commerce Bank, to name a few, can help to handle your business finances and, conversely, take some of the stress off your role as an Owner. It’s worth checking out one of these time-saving services and thus provide yourself time to put a little life back into your hustle.", "score": 0.8506771850045632, "step": 10, "reward": 0.8506771922111511, "answer_reward": 1.0, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.11526782486247951, "llm_reward": 0.8506771850045632, "utility": 0.31313848178659404, "reward_gap": 0.7354093601420837, "source": "medium"}

However, professional cleaners can be a lifesaver before moving in. Imagine getting a sparkling and clean place on reaching the new home. Read on to know how hiring the best move–in cleaning services for the home can help you.\n\n· Make your move-in stress free\n\nMoving to a new home is overwhelming, but the stress of cleaning may keep you on your toes. Almost 45% of Americans think that moving is the most stressful event of life. You already have a lot of things to do, like unpacking the boxes, organizing the new space, managing the kids and a lot more. So, let professional cleaners take away some of your stress and make every inch of your new home spotless.\n\n· Help save time\n\nCleaning the dust and allergens of a new house is a time-consuming task. So, when you already have so many things to do while moving in, why let cleaning eat up your valuable time. Let professionals do it and you can use your valuable time in exploring the home, new neighborhood, and the town.\n\n· Professionals may help in the fresh start\n\nHiring professional move-in cleaning services means you don’t have to clean the house after a long day of moving. So, another benefit of hiring a professional cleaner is that you will find a scrubbed ad sanitized home where you can unpack and enjoy just after moving in. Making a fresh start in the new house is a great idea rather than worrying about the cleaning.\n\n· Removal of pollutants and allergens\n\nThe professional cleaners ensure the removal of allergens and pollutants to minimize the risk of allergies, asthma, and respiratory issues. Even if you are good at cleaning, professionals are experienced, and they can help in better cleaning than the DIY cleaning. Professionals know which cleaning supplies and tools are better for a new house. So, hiring a professional cleaner is also good for the health of your family.\n\nSo, are you also looking for move-in cleaning services in New Orleans?

The parts that come out of your belly, Visceral fat, actually act as a hormonal gland. They exude a lot of enzymes, cytokines, and proteins, which actually originate from insulin deficiency.\n\nThey are actually protecting themselves, especially in that area, where you do everything you can, but that requires belly fat.

It is a feature that affects the plot's value and stability.\n\n**Example: 200 Agrum Plots**\nIf you have 200 Agrum plots, you can tag multiple buildings if they fit within the plot boundaries. For instance, you can tag 10 buildings on a 20 Agrum plot and 20 buildings on a 10 Agrum plot.\n\n**Insurance**\nInsurance for buildings is provided by in-world businesses, not the Lootverse ecosystem itself.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification.\n</response>", "gts": "Information about the building, such as its size, the number of rooms in the building, and the number of occupants the building can accommodate (for those Lootizens planning to rent out their building) will also be available.\n\nOnce buildings are purchased, they can either be kept by the building owner or tagged to the owner’s plot. To tag a building onto your land, you would first need to view the measurements of the building in terms of Agrums (each Agrum is equivalent to a square foot in Lootverse) and then pay LTTs to have the Loot NFT team measure your plot of land to determine if the building would fit on your plot. For example, if your plot measures 200 Agrums, you can not tag a building that measures more than this amount. However, multiple buildings can be tagged onto your plot as long as they fit).\n\nOnce you tag a building onto your plot, you can not sell that plot without the building. Lootizens looking to demolish or improve their buildings will need to pay per Agrum to do so with LTT. Tagging buildings to your plot of land could improve the value of the plot like in the real world.\n\nAlso, the God Matrix may impact your plot with natural disasters. With buildings on your plot and LTTs at stake, you may need to acquire insurance from an in-world insurance business to protect your property from the effects of the God Matrix.", "score": 0.6624649954527047, "step": 10, "reward": 0.66246497631073, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3234262819778548, "llm_reward": 0.6624649954527047, "utility": 0.46288075183544275, "reward_gap": 0.3390387134748499, "source": "medium"}

It can help us connect with our authentic selves and set goals in a more meaningful way than just chasing numbers.\n\nOne of the key ways music influences motivation is by fostering a sense of community and connection. When we listen to music, we often find ourselves in sync with others, whether it's through shared experiences or simply enjoying the same tunes. This sense of belonging can be incredibly motivating, as it reminds us that we are part of something larger than ourselves.\n\nMoreover, music can help us focus on the 'atmosphere' rather than just the numbers. For instance, instead of setting a specific target for financial security, we might aim for an atmosphere of financial stability. This approach allows us to appreciate the journey and the process, rather than just the end result. Similarly, instead of setting a specific goal for a relationship, we might aim for an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. This can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful relationship.\n\nSašo Tušar, a photographer from Unsplash, beautifully captures this idea in his photo titled \"Atmosphere.\" His images often depict serene and peaceful scenes, which can inspire us to focus on the atmosphere rather than just the numbers.\n\nIn conclusion, music can be a powerful tool for motivation. By focusing on the atmosphere and the journey, we can set goals that are more meaningful and fulfilling. Whether it's through shared experiences, a sense of community, or a focus on the atmosphere, music can help us connect with our authentic selves and set goals in a more meaningful way.\n\n---\n\nI hope this meets your expectations.

If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient.

DareNFT has developed a suite of products to address some of the challenges in the NFT landscape, including unrecognized benefits between NFTs, unrecognized relationships between NFT owners and hidden risks of NFT ownership. There are many content types out there and whereas the content types matter at application level, the licensing protocol layer is the same for all of them. Therefore, there is only one protocol needed to serve all.\n\nThe existing licencing processes of derivative content are mostly manual and time consuming. With an NFT 2.0 smart contract, these processes can be automated. Derivative content such as: song remixes, subtitled videos, edited images, learning contents, translated book often generates revenue from the rental and subscription business model. Creators can receive royalties from reproducer’s revenue via the NFT smart contract. This speeds up collaboration and sharing of benefits between the author and re-publisher, resulting in more income for both parties.\n\nThe advent of the NFT 2.0 protocol that DareNFT proposes can mark a new milestone for nonfungible tokens and the crypto market in general. The platform’s competitive advantage is its ability to adapt to emerging trends, banking on its NFT 2.0 protocol which is an essential element for building a thriving platform.\n\nDareNFT will provide InPoker with the access to its ecosystem and the NFT marketplace where InPoker plans to list some of the Elite NFT membership cards. This long-term partnership marks a significant milestone in InPoker’s efforts to introduce the cutting edge technologies to online gaming.\n\nVisit DareNFT: https://darenft.com/\n\nStay tuned for more exciting developments on https://www.inpoker.io\n\nJoin our official Telegram Channel here: https://t.me/influencerpoker", "score": 0.6549098204913777, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6549098491668701, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.19465697313454386, "llm_reward": 0.6549098204913777, "utility": 0.3570472844497477, "reward_gap": 0.4602528473568338, "source": "medium"}

Another fascinating thing is cost accounting; many people associate it with production companies. For the records, that is not very correct. Let us look at some eye opening questions.\n\nAt PEOTEF\n\nHow much does it take you to serve that product to a client? Do you have a specific response or it depends? How much does it take you to provide that service to that client? Do you know what direct cost is? What about indirect or overheads cost? What if you knew how to classify these costs appropriately either by function, behavior or nature? Let me ask this unusual question for those who own schools. How much does it cost you to train one student or pupil per semester? What costs did you take into consideration in this process? On what bases did you apportion your overheads?\n\nFollow me.\n\nWhat if as a business owner, you knew the cost of adding an extra service to your business? What if you knew the exact cost of adding an extra service to your line of services? What if you knew the exact cost of adding a new client to the number of clients you already have? Do you know the concept of Marginal costing and revenue?\n\nWhen someone mentions something about a business breaking even; what comes to your mind? I'm sure you will definitely it is that time in a business when there is neither a profit nor loss. You are right. Permit me to ask. What happens in the case of a business that has been operating, and then launches a new product? Will their profit levels remain the same if they do not make profits on the new product? Is it possible to ascertain the cost of the new product and determine when that product alone will breakeven?\n\nThank you for your time.

Here’s a draft of the article using the structure you provided:\n\n---\n\n**Health Is Not Fitness, But We Need Both**\n\nIn today's fast-paced world, the terms \"health\" and \"fitness\" are often used interchangeably, but they represent fundamentally different concepts. While fitness is a measure of physical well-being and the ability to perform specific activities, health encompasses a broader range of factors that contribute to overall well-being. Let’s explore the distinction between health and fitness and why both are essential for a balanced and fulfilling life.\n\n**Understanding Health**\n\nHealth is a multifaceted concept that includes physical, mental, and social well-being. It encompasses a wide array of factors such as nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress management, and social support. Health is not just the absence of disease; it is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. By focusing on health, we aim to improve our quality of life and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\n\n**Fitness: A Narrow Focus**\n\nFitness, on the other hand, is a more specific and measurable aspect of health. It typically refers to the ability to perform physical activities and maintain a certain level of physical fitness. Fitness can be assessed through various metrics such as body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, and flexibility. While fitness is important, it is just one component of overall health.\n\n**The Connection Between Health and Fitness**\n\nWhile health and fitness are distinct concepts, they are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a healthy lifestyle is often the foundation for achieving optimal fitness. By focusing on health, we can improve our physical and mental well-being, which in turn enhances our fitness levels. For example, regular exercise can strengthen our muscles and improve our cardiovascular health, but it is only one part of the equation. A balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management are also crucial for maintaining optimal fitness.\n\n**Why Both Are Important**\n\nBoth health and fitness are essential for a healthy and fulfilling life. Health provides the foundation for physical and mental well-being, while fitness enhances our ability to perform daily activities and enjoy physical pursuits. By prioritizing both, we can achieve a balanced and sustainable lifestyle that supports our overall well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while fitness is an important aspect of health, it is just one component of a broader and more comprehensive approach to well-being. By focusing on health, we can improve our physical and mental well-being, which in turn enhances our fitness levels. Let’s strive to achieve a balance between health and fitness to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to review this draft and let me know if you have any suggestions or if you want to make any adjustments.\n</response>", "gts": "What is the meaning of fitness? Well, that depends on who you ask. The word fitness can be spread thin when it comes to defining what it is. Fitness can have a different meaning for different groups because it is activity-specific.\n\nPhysical fitness for a powerlifter is not the same kind of fitness for a triathlete. In general, physical fitness is being able to apply the required strength and energy to complete specific physical activities. If a powerlifter cannot complete a triathlon, then he would not be considered fit among a group of competing triathletes.\n\nHealth is different from fitness, but like fitness, there are variations of health. In general, health is being free from illness and sustaining overall wellness. Within this concept, the dimensions of health are physical, mental, and social. Having a healthy body that is not affected by disease or physical impairments is a general description of physical health.\n\nGood mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. It means you are in a state of well-being where you feel good and function well in the world. Some keys to being in a state of good mental health are:\n\nthe ability to learn\n\nthe ability to feel, express, and manage a range of positive and negative emotions\n\nthe ability to form and maintain good relationships with others\n\nthe ability to cope with and manage change and uncertainty.\n\nThe ability to develop and maintain quality friendships, stay true to yourself while adapting to social situations, and engage with others in your community (work, clubs, religious settings, etc.) are all signs of good social health.\n\nHealth and fitness are often conflated because neither can be attained without proper nutrition. Yes, your mental health is impacted by a poor diet. Nutritional information is a description of how you are either contributing to health and fitness, which are dimensions of wellness or feeding into sickness and disease.\n\nLearn tips for staying well and losing weight during this pandemic:", "score": 0.8193678094989855, "step": 10, "reward": 0.8193678259849548, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.36172218727537647, "llm_reward": 0.8193678094989855, "utility": 0.5444111646862204, "reward_gap": 0.457645622223609, "source": "medium"}

If in the previous articles we explained why it’s important to localize for the Polish, Finish, Swedish, Dutch and Danish markets, with this post we’ll start our series of articles about localization for Western Europe.\n\nBasically, this means to translate and adapt your game from all points of view to the four audiences: French, Italian, German, and Spanish.

The image features a delicate watercolor painting of a tea egg, surrounded by a scene that highlights the contrast between beauty and disgust.\n\nThe tea egg itself is a focal point, with its rich, golden color and intricate details.

This detail is crucial in creating a sense of depth and realism.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes a spinach wonton soup, which is partially ruined by a cigarette butt. This juxtaposition of a delicately prepared dish and a discarded cigarette butt creates a powerful contrast. The wilted spinach and the greasy residue of the cigarette butt together evoke a sense of decay and neglect, adding to the overall tension and emotional impact of the scene.\n\nThe tea egg and the spinach wonton soup are both central to the image, but they serve different purposes. The tea egg represents the refined and luxurious aspects of the scene, while the spinach wonton soup symbolizes the more mundane and potentially unpleasant elements.

Why did someone ruin the soup with the cigarette without even finishing the soup first?\n\nThe reason why the picture can spark such vivid scenarios in me must be due to the realism in its style, constructed using watercolor. This is no small feat technically. The white highlight dots scattered on top of the wontons and spinach contribute to the glossy wetness. The ingenious discoloration on some of the yellowed spinach, a sign of decay and imperfection, makes this soup even more convincing. Chopped spring onions and a fractured leaf of cilantro floating in the foreground invites the tongue to touch them. The brown soup almost looks like there is miso in there, as if smoke is spreading nebulously. The runny egg yolk looks good, but the egg white engulfing is looks disgusting.

According to recent data, there have been over 6000 flight cancellations during the busy season. This is a significant increase from previous years, highlighting the need for travelers to be prepared.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns for travelers is the effectiveness of masks. Recent debates have intensified, with some airlines and industry leaders advocating for mask mandates. For instance, Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly tested positive for COVID-19 after a maskless hearing, sparking discussions about the role of masks in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nThe airline industry is facing its own set of challenges. Staff shortages and health protocols have become major hurdles. Airlines are implementing new measures to ensure safety, but the ongoing staffing issues are causing delays and cancellations. It’s crucial for travelers to stay informed and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe journey.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments or additional information.\n</response>", "gts": "6000+ Cancelled flights on the busiest travel time of the year\n\nHow do you know who to trust?\n\nHere is a little food for thought.\n\nThe airline industry is in the midst of a record-breaking winter crisis, with thousands stranded around Christmas time. As if it wasn’t enough that flights were canceled on top days like Christmas Eve and Christmas day there have been over 1,700 US flights canceled because there are too many employees with positive Covid tests.\n\n(CNN Business) Major US airlines canceled hundreds of more flights Sunday, the third day in a row of mass cancellations and delays over Christmas weekend, as staff and crew call out sick amid the Omicron surge.\n\nThis comes on the heels of several airline CEOs telling congress they don’t think masks “add anything” to the safety of flying.\n\nThe Airline CEOs were testifying to Congress about how they spent the Covid money they received during the pandemic. They made headlines by questioning the effectiveness of masks on airlines with the results of a study done on mannequins.\n\nAccording to Forbes.com, the studies the CEOs had referenced were “done with mannequins who were sitting straight forward with masks on, not removing them, not eating at any point in time,” Nelson said. “So it is important to recognize that the safe controlled environment on the plane is a layered safety protocol, which includes the sanitation of the aircraft and includes the service procedures and includes the HEPA filtration that is not on all aircraft, by the way, and it includes everyone wearing the masks.”\n\nInterestingly enough, the CEO of Southwest Airlines Gary Kelly tested positive with Covid-19 two days after appearing at the hearing maskless. He is fully vaccinated, boosted, and still contracted Covid. He didn’t make an informed decision. Don’t be like Gary. Listen to the scientist and the data.\n\nCan face masks help slow the spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19? Yes.

As it had been over five years since I had taken a Spanish course I guess I really shouldn’t have been surprised right? Who can really expect to remember much from a high school course that was mediocre at best? As I tried desperately to order a simple sandwich and something to drink, I realized that if I didn’t at least attempt to learn Spanish I would most likely starve after a week or so.\n\nHow exactly does one go about learning Spanish in a Latin American country? Seems pretty easy right? Well, I assure you it is not, especially when your entire day is spent speaking English. Another obstacle that I quickly encountered was the very rapid way in which everyone speaks in this city. It is amazing how a sentence containing 10 words or so can come out sounding almost like one long word. Is that what English sounds like to people who don’t speak English? It is exceedingly difficult to learn words in another language when you are unable to decipher exactly where one word ends and another begins. This process is made even harder by the fact that most people here fail to pronounce the whole word anyway. There were many words that I was convinced I knew and was using quite frequently. Imagine my dismay when I found out they had whole other syllables on the end of the word. No wonder I had been getting funny looks from people on the street and in restaurants.\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that an actual course was needed or even better, a private tutor of some sort. The only way I was ever going to learn Spanish was by actually sitting down and studying with someone who could answer the myriad of questions that arose every day. Sad isn’t it?

Evidence from an exploratory study on heroic Prosecco Superiore Rive\n\nLuigino Barisan, Research Center for the Viticulture and Enology (CIRVE)\n\nLuigi Galletto, University of Padua, Research Center for the Viticulture and Enology (CIRVE)\n\nThis paper investigates why wineries producing Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Protected Denomination of Origin (CVPP) wines decided to adopt the sub-appellation (SA) “Rive” as a way to increase the value of their wines.\n\nWe estimated both a logistic and a linear regression to explain Rive SA firms’ choices and market growth drivers, respectively. By using data gathered from CVPP producers, we divided wineries into two groups, those that have adopted the Rive SA and those that have not. By means of a stepwise procedure, we categorized factors that were likely to explain the Rive SA choice within a set of structural, marketing and wine tourism-related variables.\n\nThe results showed that structural drivers such as the human capital of younger producers, pressure tank sizes, competitive positioning in the market and in the field of wine tourism hospitality, and involvement in ad hoc promotional activities (i.e., Primavera del Prosecco) have the greatest effects on the choice of the Rive SA. The synergistic effects of cellar door sales, small firm sizes and specific foreign markets (i.e., the United Kingdom and the United States) have emerged, on the other hand, as vital factors in the growth of the Rive SA in terms of market share.\n\nThe adoption of the Rive SA may play an important role in supporting and valuing the heroic viticulture-based economy and may help the CVPP Tutelary Consortium to appropriately undertake promotional strategies to differentiate wines and improve competitiveness. This could have positive effects on wine tourism, hospitality and winery visits in light of the recent recognition of the CVPP as the 55th Italian UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.36253/wep-9900\n\nRead Full Text: https://oaj.fupress.net/index.php/wep/article/view/9900", "score": 0.7668942907477814, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7668942809104919, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.36379859309689877, "llm_reward": 0.7668942907477814, "utility": 0.5281998334230018, "reward_gap": 0.4030956976508826, "source": "medium"}

The assistant strategy should aim to provide a detailed and accurate answer while minimizing user effort and time.

This method was first introduced in 1992 during the World Cup, where England faced Australia in the semi-final. The incident where England lost 22 runs in 1 ball highlighted the complexity and unpredictability of the D/L method. This led to a debate about the rule's fairness and the need for a more straightforward system.\n\nIn 2003, the D/L method faced another significant challenge during the World Cup, particularly in the match between South Africa and Sri Lanka. The incident involving Mark Boucher, who dropped a simple chance, further exposed the flaws in the D/L method. This dropped single led to a significant reduction in the target score, which ultimately cost South Africa the match.\n\nThe D/L method is based on a series of mathematical equations that take into account the number of overs lost, the number of runs scored, and the number of wickets lost. However, its complexity often leads to confusion and controversy. Hariprasath argues that the D/L method should be simplified to make it more transparent and easier to understand for all stakeholders, including players, umpires, and spectators.\n\nTo summarize, the D/L method has been a contentious issue in cricket, with its complexity leading to several high-profile incidents. The 1992 World Cup incident and the 2003 South Africa vs. Sri Lanka match highlight the need for a more straightforward approach to managing interrupted matches.\n</response>", "gts": "By Hariprasath\n\nMany matches have been turned on its head by the Duckworth Lewis method especially the South African side were always on the wrong side of the result. Even the cricket pundits had difficulty in grasping this rule. The complexity of this rule has led to many controversies, and the difficulty involved in calculating the appropriate score in the rain-affected matches has led to many chaotic situations.\n\nThe controversy regarding this rule was raised at the infamous semifinal in the 1992 world cup. South Africa's side was on the verge of victory before the rain interrupted. South Africa needed 22 of 13 to win before rain interrupted. Ten minutes later, the South African side was informed that they need to score 22 of 1 ball, and this incident raised all sorts of heated discussion on the Duckworth Lewis rule.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and first-class matches (the ‘Professional Edition’), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in proportion to the two teams’ resources, i.e.,\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 70% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 220 with 100% of resources available, then 220 × 70% / 100% = 154, so Team 2’s target is 154, and the score to tie is 153. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, so a computer that has this software loaded must be used.\n\nThe other instance where South Africa ended up on the wrong side of the result was at the 2003 world cup.

Here’s a brief explanation of 'Accounts from Incomplete Records':\n\nAccounts from Incomplete Records refer to financial records that do not have complete information, such as missing transactions or partial entries. This can occur due to various reasons like human error, system failures, or incomplete data collection.\n\nThese accounts are used when full records are not available, and it's necessary to make financial adjustments based on the available data. For example, if a company has incomplete sales records, they might use these accounts to estimate sales figures for financial reporting purposes.\n\nIn contrast, the double-entry system is a more comprehensive method where every transaction is recorded in two accounts: one as a debit and one as a credit. This ensures that the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) remains balanced.\n\nTo help clarify, could you provide some specific examples of incomplete records you're working with?\n</response>", "gts": "Accounting records, which aren’t strictly kept consistent with the double-entry bookkeeping system are referred to as Accounts from incomplete records. Many authors describe it as a single entry system.\n\nHowever, a single-entry bookkeeping system may be a misnomer because there’s no such system for maintaining accounting records. It is also not a ‘shortcut’ method as an alternate to the double-entry bookkeeping system. It is rather a mechanism of maintaining records whereby some transactions are recorded with proper debits and credits while just in the case of others, either one-sided or no entry is formed.\n\nAccounts from Incomplete Records\n\nNormally, under this technique records of money and private accounts of debtors and creditors are properly maintained, while the knowledge concerning assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues is partially recorded.

Here are some tips for overcoming embarrassment when others might hear your warmups:\n\n1. **Practice in a Familiar Space**: Start by practicing in a space where you feel comfortable, like your home or a friend's house. Gradually work your way up to more public spaces.\n\n2. **Record Yourself**: Record your practice sessions and listen back to them. This can help you identify areas for improvement and build confidence.\n\n3. **Join a Supportive Community**: Look for local singing groups or online forums where you can practice with others. Supportive communities can provide encouragement and help you feel more comfortable.\n\nFor singers traveling in hotels who need private practice spaces, here are some strategies:\n\n1. **Ask Front Desk for Quiet Rooms**: Many hotels have rooms designated for quiet use. Ask the front desk if they have any rooms that can be reserved for practice.\n\n2. **Use Hotel Amenities**: Hotels often have quiet areas like libraries or lounges. These can be great for practicing without disturbing others.\n\n3. **Pre-Book a Private Practice Room**: Some hotels offer private practice rooms for a fee. Check with the hotel’s concierge or front desk to see if this is available.\n\nWould any of these tips be particularly helpful for you?\n</response>", "gts": "A lot of you might live in apartments with thin walls and feel embarrassed about singing and especially practicing those vocal exercises comfortably where others can here you. I know many of you resort to practicing in the car.\n\nSome of you, are regular travelers and need to find a place whilst on the road, where you can still exercise the voice without feeling inhibited…staying in hotels.\n\nWhen on stage for a performance, this is the part of us that we are happy to show to the world. The finished product. But the preparation to get us ready to be there, where we might make mistakes, we are experimenting, learning, warming up, trying new material…that is commonly the side of singing and public speaking which is not a public affair. We need to find a place where we are comfortable to perform these tasks.\n\nAs a singer and speaker, and particularly, someone who is establishing new techniques, it is important to exercise the voice on a daily basis. Your voice coach will hopefully have given you exercises to improve your breathing, strengthen your vocal cords, improve your range, pitch and vocal stamina.\n\nSo can you get over the phobia of practising when other people might hear you?\n\nFirstly, I say…don’t be shy to be warming up your voice. It’s part of the preparation and it’s what will make you sound awesome on stage, and in everyday life as well as a speaker. If your a singer or a public speaker and your your good enough to have a gig, anyone hearing your warmups will not be thinking…oMg what an awful singer next door. Quite the opposite. Be bold and do what you have to do. Invite your neighbours to your gigs, rehearsals or to hear your run through your presentation or keynote.\n\nSame when you are in a hotel. Who cares…you will most likely not have to see these guests again.\n\nAs for practicing in your car. It’s not a bad idea. Posture is not the best. But if you feel you have more privacy here and will be more effective then, it’s better than nothing at all. I do however recommend that you pull over and practice for the 10–20mins on the side of the road. Singing and vocalisation exercises can take quite a lot of concentration and some people even find the breathing can make them feel dizzy, so driving at the same time is not recommended.", "score": 0.7848739415825143, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7848739624023438, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.29148505364200944, "llm_reward": 0.7848739415825143, "utility": 0.4783085018734191, "reward_gap": 0.4933888879405049, "source": "medium"}

Ensure your ad creative is engaging and relevant.\n- **Thumbnail Effectiveness**: Use the formula: **Effectiveness% = (3-second video plays / total video plays)**. This metric helps you understand how effective your thumbnail is at capturing attention.\n\n### Scroll-Stopping and Funnel Impact\n- **Scroll-Stopping**: This refers to elements that keep users engaged and scrolling through your page. If underperforming, consider improving your ad copy, images, or calls-to-action.\n- **Impact on Funnel**: Scroll-stopping elements can significantly impact the rest of the funnel. If they are weak, it can lead to lower engagement and conversions.

Create High-Quality Content**\nContent is king on Instagram. High-quality images and videos that are visually appealing and relevant to your audience will attract more followers. Invest in good photography and editing tools to ensure your posts stand out. Consistency is key, so plan your content in advance and stick to a posting schedule.\n\n**3. Utilize Hashtags and Tags**\nHashtags are a powerful tool for increasing visibility. Research popular and relevant hashtags for your niche and use them consistently in your posts. This will help your content reach a wider audience. Additionally, using relevant tags can improve discoverability and engagement.\n\n**4. Engage with Your Audience**\nEngagement is vital for building a loyal following. Respond to comments and messages promptly. Ask questions and encourage your followers to share their thoughts. This interaction will help you build a community around your brand.\n\n**5. Collaborate with Influencers and Brands**\nCollaborating with influencers and brands can significantly boost your reach. Look for influencers in your niche who have a similar audience and reach out to them. Offer to collaborate on content or guest post opportunities. This can help you tap into their existing followers and expand your reach.\n\n**6. Use Instagram Stories and Reels**\nInstagram Stories and Reels are great for creating short, engaging content. Use these features to share behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks, and interactive polls.

Competition is fierce in almost every niche. Whatever your niche is, you should validate it by researching your competition. Let us explain how you should go about this and also why.\n\nStep 1: Demand and Supply\n\nThe essence of most businesses can be boiled down to one reality, demand and supply.\n\nIf there is enough demand then you can cater to the supply. If there isn’t enough demand, then catering to supply doesn’t make any sense.\n\nIf there is only one diner in a locality, then it is likely to do well. If there are too many diners and not many people to fill up all those places, then most of those enterprises will run out of business.\n\nLikewise, a digital enterprise or any online niche must have enough demand for there to be space to exist. While firms or endeavours can always coexist, the pie gets smaller and there is just less in it for everyone. The hard reality is that if there are enough players in a niche already and some of them have already amassed a massive market share, then penetrating their share or usurping a chunk of it will be a herculean task.\n\nStudy your competition to find out how large a market is and if some of your competitors are already catering to the needs of the audience. If you intend to do the same thing in the same niche, then there is little or no possibility for your enterprise to find a foothold, let aside being a roaring success.\n\nStep 2: Niche within a Niche!\n\nIt is unlikely that the niche you have planned to target will be completely void of competition. There may be stiff or less competition. If there are players already with humongous market shares and dedicated customers or audiences, then you need to find a niche within a niche. You cannot cater to the same exact niche that your competition is committed to.\n\nFor instance, if you are planning to target the niche of food, cuisine or anything culinary, then you can find some subset that the existing players have not touched upon yet. If that is not possible, then you must figure out what you are best at and use that authority to create a niche within a niche.\n\nIt is all about the value you can offer to your audience and how you help, change or enrich their lives.", "score": 0.583640915673977, "step": 10, "reward": 0.5836409330368042, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.175, "user_reward": 0.3145981408925625, "llm_reward": 0.583640915673977, "utility": 0.42850011320869685, "reward_gap": 0.26904277478141453, "source": "medium"}

Here’s a draft for a short article about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in India, focusing on land record management and welfare distribution:\n\n---\n\n**Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in India: Breaking Down Myths and Enhancing Transparency**\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including land record management and welfare distribution. In India, these areas often suffer from significant issues of corruption and inefficiency. By leveraging blockchain, we can significantly reduce fraud and ensure transparency.\n\n**Land Record Management**\n\nLand records are a critical aspect of any country's governance. In India, land records are prone to corruption, leading to disputes and inefficiencies. Blockchain can help by providing a tamper-proof and transparent system for recording land transactions. Each transaction can be recorded on a blockchain, ensuring that all parties involved have access to the same, immutable record. This not only prevents fraud but also ensures that land records are accurate and up-to-date.\n\n**Welfare Distribution**\n\nWelfare schemes in India often face issues of corruption and inefficiency, leading to the misallocation of funds. Blockchain can help by creating a transparent and secure system for distributing welfare benefits. Each transaction can be recorded on a blockchain, ensuring that the funds are used as intended. This can help reduce corruption and ensure that the intended beneficiaries receive the benefits they deserve.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to add any specific details or examples to these points?\n</response>", "gts": "But but blockchain is for criminals…\n\nToo many times have we heard this argument. It is almost a meme by now. It is a bit true, but also a lot wrong. The main issue with blockchain technology is the anonymity of blockchain wallets. Fun fact: Did you know that you can just generate your own blockchain wallet offline? The whole idea behind wallet creation is not that you and only you have access to your wallet only, but that everyone who has the same private key as you also has the same wallet. The “security” only stems from one aspect: Stochastics! Two people have a very very low chance to create the same wallet. For example, MetaMask creates them using 2048 seed words. In total, you need 12 of them to create a wallet. Therefore, there are 204⁸¹² possibilities. Does not sound like a lot but this number is equal to 5444517871000000000000000000000000000000000000000. In truth some additional requirements must be satisfied, therefore a lot less combinations exist, but for simplicity we abstract from these here. All of these wallets are therefore entirely anonymous. The only way to know who has access to which address is by creating a mapping between a person’s real identity and the wallet address they have used for a transaction. Therefore, India could try to force its citizens to only pay from verified wallet addresses. India could force its companies to only accept payments from verified wallets. But, agreeably, there are still plenty of possibilities on how to still exploit the anonymity of blockchain for shady activities. There’s one crucial aspect to the blockchain though: It keeps a log of every transaction ever executed forever, redundantly backed up on thousands or even millions of servers worldwide. Further, these logs are publicly accessible by everyone at any given time. Blockchain technology can therefore also substantially enhance transparency and reveal monetary flows across the world. It acts as an ultimate threat: Yes, you can engage in illegal transactions, but should your wallet address ever become traceable back to you, even if only by accident, everyone can see what you’ve done. Therefore, India should not ban “private” (i.e.. “decentralized”) blockchains, but rather embrace them and build systems around them to enhance both their transparency and security.", "score": 0.7757607496696233, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7757607698440552, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.31846010549413, "llm_reward": 0.7757607496696233, "utility": 0.4970400891054902, "reward_gap": 0.45730064417549326, "source": "medium"}

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Hey, I need an article about tips for choosing commercial cleaning services. Can you help me outline the main points?Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous.

Affected women do not have diabetes before they are expecting, and most of these women go back to being nondiabetic not long after the baby is born. Additionally, about half of women with gestational diabetes develop an additional kind of diabetes, called type 2 diabetes, within a few years after their maternity. Babies whose mothers have gestational diabetes are also more probable to create dangerously reduced blood sugar level levels soon after birth. Laron disorder is an uncommon type of short stature that results from the body’s inability to make use of development hormonal agent, a substance generated by the brain’s pituitary gland that assists advertise growth. The signs and signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome vary, also among affected members of the exact same family. Studies recommend that people with Laron syndrome have a significantly reduced danger of cancer and type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, people with Laron disorder do not seem to have an enhanced life expectancy compared to their unaffected loved ones. Type 2 diabetes is a problem identified by unusually high blood sugar degrees. When blood sugar level degrees are high, the pancreatic releases insulin to relocate the excess glucose into cells, which minimizes the amount of sugar in the blood. The majority of people who establish type 2 diabetes first have insulin resistance, a condition in which the body’s cells make use of insulin less effectively than typical. Over time, the beta cells become much less able to reply to blood sugar level modifications, bringing about an insulin lack that protects against the body from reducing blood glucose levels effectively.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the text is machine-generated by the Brevi Technologies’ Natural language Generation model, and we do not bear any responsibility.

In this case, the wider community can use this technology.\n\nAs explained by Meta,“Spark AR Go is an iOS app designed to let creators whose first mediums maybe something like photography, memes, art, or video express themselves and their perspectives through AR. Creators will be able to extend their personal brands, assets, and creative vision to fans in new ways — like with custom AR quizzes, unique background replacement, or a one-of-a-kind makeup look.”\n\nSpark AR Go includes built-in templates, switch and slide tools, and other options to make it easier to augment reality, giving artists and even non-artists more opportunities to present their AR photos.\n\nSimilar to Snapchat Lens Studio, Meta hopes to make more people interested in this option by providing a simpler and more efficient augmented reality flow.\n\nYounger users align with the platform that leads the way and moves with the tide. This is in favor of the meta. The question is, can meta attract the young generation’s attention and be liked by them? Because it is the young people who help the meta to progress and become pervasive.\n\nBy opening up their tools to more developers, there is quite a chance that Meta could face the popular AR tools.

We are excited to collaborate with them on initiatives that aim to minimize waste and promote sustainable practices. The Rubbish Project has been working closely with Huhtamaki, a leading manufacturer in the packaging industry, to develop innovative solutions that support a closed-loop system.\n\nOne of the key impacts of our collaboration is the reduction of plastic waste. While the exact numbers are still being finalized, we can highlight that our closed-loop system is designed to significantly decrease plastic waste, contributing to a more sustainable future.\n\n---\n\n**Follow us on social media:**\n\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)\n- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/)\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)\n\n---\n\nFeel free to add any specific quotes or details you might have from stakeholders.

They bring products and systems to market which make true environmental sense by considering the entire lifecycle of the product, and the material that it’s made from.\n\nThe Rubbish Project, has developed a circular economy system, which has been adopted by packing companies including Huhtamaki to expand their sustainable packaging solutions worldwide. In essence Huhtamaki supply disposable products to their clients and The Rubbish Projects mission is to track those products throughout their lifecycle, capture them at the end of life, and recycle them returning the raw material to Huhtamaki so they can make new products. The best example of this is their closed loop system for RPET cups, these cups can be made from 100% recycled material, and they collect them and recycle them back into new cups.\n\n$BEACH understands that as part of the ecosystem, circular economies are required to process all the plastics that we are removing from our beaches and oceans. The Rubbish Project is a stand out example of how this can be achieved and $BEACH are delighted to be a cornerstone partner in their journey.\n\nThe Rubbish Project\n\nVisit The Rubbish Project Socials Below\n\nWebsite: https://therubbishproject.com/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/rubbishproject?lang=en\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rubbish-project/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/therubbishproject/\n\nWaste Collection to New Products\n\nVisit $BEACH Socials Below\n\nTelegram Room\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\n\nMedium\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn", "score": 0.659313735396469, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6593137383460999, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.31974821848278256, "llm_reward": 0.659313735396469, "utility": 0.4591452845388371, "reward_gap": 0.3395655169136864, "source": "medium"}

Two prominent players in this space are MakerBot and Formlabs. While MakerBot initially embraced an open-source approach, they eventually pivoted to a closed-source model as they scaled. This shift highlights the challenges and opportunities faced by both companies.\n\n**MakerBot’s Journey**\n\nMakerBot, founded by Bre Pettis, initially aimed to democratize 3D printing by making the technology accessible to everyone. They released their first 3D printer, the Replicator, under an open-source license, allowing anyone to modify and improve the design. However, as MakerBot grew, they faced the challenge of maintaining control over their intellectual property. In 2013, they announced a closed-source model, which allowed them to protect their proprietary designs and focus on innovation. This pivot was a strategic move to ensure their continued success and market dominance.\n\n**Formlabs: Innovation and Inspiration**\n\nFormlabs, on the other hand, has taken a different approach. Founded by Max Lobonick and Ben Gruenbaum, Formlabs is known for its innovative laser-based 3D printing technology. They have successfully leveraged crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter to fund their projects and attract a passionate community. Formlabs’ journey is a testament to the power of innovation and community support. Their success story, including the development of the Form 2 printer and the Form 3, showcases how startups can compete with established giants.\n\n**Ethical Considerations in 3D Printing**\n\nThe ethical implications of 3D printing are a critical aspect of this narrative. While 3D printing has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, it also raises concerns about the misuse of technology. One notable example is the use of 3D printing for prosthetics. Customized prosthetics can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, the ethical concerns arise when 3D printing is used to create illegal firearms. This juxtaposition highlights the need for regulatory frameworks to ensure that 3D printing technology is used responsibly.\n\nIn conclusion, the competition between MakerBot and Formlabs is a microcosm of the broader struggle between open-source and closed-source approaches in the tech industry. Both companies have faced unique challenges and have found innovative solutions. The ethical considerations surrounding 3D printing underscore the importance of responsible innovation and regulation.\n\n---\n\nThis article covers the key points while staying within the 500-word limit.

Now bitcoin is taking its place,” he tweeted earlier this month. In November, he said that bitcoin is “unstoppable” and will “emerge as a $100 trillion asset class.” Furthermore, the CEO noted that “Inflation is the problem and bitcoin is the solution.”\n\nWhat do you think about Microstrategy buying more bitcoin?

Among the thousands of attendees was 9-year-old Ezra, who was attending with his family. The festival, known for its thrilling rides and music, was a place of joy for many, but it also had its share of safety concerns.\n\nEzra and his family were part of the crowd that day, enjoying the festivities. However, tragedy struck during the concert. The festival had a history of safety issues, and on that day, the crowd surged, leading to a stampede that claimed the lives of several people, including Ezra.\n\nThe incident occurred during the concert, where the crowd was already in a state of excitement. The stampede was triggered by a malfunctioning ride, causing panic and chaos. Despite the efforts of festival staff and emergency responders, Ezra was among those who did not survive.\n\nThe family of Ezra has been actively involved in legal actions to hold the festival organizers and authorities accountable for the incident. They are seeking justice and ensuring that such tragedies do not happen again.\n\nThe Astroworld Festival tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the importance of safety measures and the need for continuous improvement in event management. The community is mourning the loss of Ezra and is working together to support his family during this difficult time.\n\nPlease provide any additional feedback or details you would like to include.\n</response>", "gts": "A tenth person has died from injuries suffered at last weekend’s Astroworld Festival. Nine-year-old Ezra Blount passed away Sunday, according to a statement released by his family’s attorney.\n\n“The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son,” the Blount family attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. “This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert, what should have been a joyful celebration. Ezra’s death is absolutely heartbreaking. We are committed to seeking answers and justice for the Blount family. But tonight we stand in solidarity with the family, in grief, and in prayer.”\n\nBlount was sitting on his father’s shoulders during Travis Scott’s headlining set on Friday night when the two suddenly found themselves trapped in a crowd surge. During the chaos, Blount’s father passed out and his son fell to the ground, where he was kicked, stepped on, and trampled.\n\nBlount suffered severe injuries to his liver, kidney, and brain, which caused him to go into cardiac arrest. Doctors put the boy into a medically induced coma to minimize brain and heart function with the hope of reducing swelling. Unfortunately, the boy succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.\n\nPrior to Ezra’s passing, the Blount family filed a lawsuit against Travis Scott and Live Nation, the producers of Astroworld. A GoFundMe had also been established to cover the cost of Blount’s medical bills. As of Sunday evening, the family had raised close to $70,000 in donations.\n\nPolice are investigating the circumstances that led to the crowd surge, which took the lives of nine other people, ranging in age from 14 to 27.

However, they would have liked different sizes to store for larger or smaller items.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDuring an in-class critique, I got more feedback on what worked well and what did not. The shape was cute and popular. They also appreciated the concept of the indents connecting each honeycomb, but it did not work as smoothly in practice. Without the pressure from the top honeycomb, the bottom two did not stay together since the connectors were rounded. Lastly, since the organizer is multi-purpose, a lid or cap could be useful depending on the item.\n\nOverall, this was great practice with 3D modeling software and printers. The actual prototype itself definitely needs more improvements. In the future, I will experiment with different sizes. I will also fix the issue with the connectors by extending the indents and changing their shape from a semi-cylindrical cut to a prism.

One fine name is Esports. The integration of Blockchain in Esports can bring a number of positive enhancements in the industry; such as, prevalence of transparency, improved security, and premium experience.\n\nTransparent Culture\n\nThe most important thing the blockchain technology can bring into eSports is the transparent culture; since no matter how much the gamer is capable enough but there are still limitations to it. Like, we still do not know how many successful gamers exist in this world. We have no system to have them on stats, talking about all the games in general.\n\nWhat blockchain can do to help eSports is that it can help gamers make profile on a decentralized network where all of their records or performance will be available and updated automatically so that sponsors can reach out to them without any barrier.\n\nHigh-End Security\n\nThere is significant amount of security issues in esports. Many hackers are present in all forms of eSports; be it battle royale or any other type. However, all the security concerns can be eliminated, if Blockchain applies its immutable technology into eSports. All the cheating and scams will be eradicated.\n\nBetter Experience\n\nIt would be false to say that eSports is in need of blockchain technology; however, better would be to say that blockchain can enhance gaming before eSports reach another level. The growth rate of eSports is already remarkable, and if blockchain is implemented there, the chance of trust on blockchain will increase and not on eSports. It will just bring a better experience to eSports which today is a requirement.\n\nFuture of Esports in Blockchain\n\nThe future seems bright but it all depends on gaming geeks who are the real ones to make it possible. Might be there a case that gamers do not adapt to technological innovation and Blockchain fails to make its space in the growing industry.

The pilot involves the Novi wallet, which will allow users to make payments without any transfer fees. The process is simple: users can click to pay, and the transaction is processed through the Novi wallet.\n\nIn the US pilot, users will be able to use the Novi wallet to send and receive payments directly from WhatsApp. This feature eliminates the need for users to navigate to a separate crypto exchange or wallet, making the payment process seamless and straightforward.\n\nThe Novi wallet is designed to be user-friendly, with a 'click-to-pay' process that allows users to initiate payments with just a few clicks. This feature is expected to make the crypto payment experience more accessible and convenient for a wider range of users.\n\nOverall, the pilot in the US is a significant step towards integrating crypto payments into WhatsApp, offering users a new and efficient way to make transactions without the complexities of traditional payment methods.\n\nWould you like to know more about the process or any other aspects of the feature?\n</response>", "gts": "WhatsApp messenger tests cryptocurrency transactions.

Here are some basic makeup tips for dusky skin tones:\n\n1. **Foundation**: Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone and has a natural finish. Look for formulas that are hydrating and blend well.\n2. **Concealer**: Use a concealer that is one shade lighter than your foundation to cover any blemishes or dark circles. Apply it with a damp beauty sponge for a seamless look.\n3. **Blush**: Use a soft, peachy blush to add warmth to your cheeks. Apply it along the apples of your cheeks and blend well.\n4. **Eyelids**: Use a shimmery, nude eyeshadow to create a subtle, dewy look. You can also add a touch of brown or gold for depth.\n5. **Lip Shades**: Opt for matte or satin lipsticks in shades like nude, coral, or peach. These colors complement dusky skin tones and add a natural glow.\n\nI hope this helps!

Never choose a shade lighter than your natural skin tone, it will make your skin look patch and dull. Foundation is used to create an even base not for brightening.\n\nConcealer\n\nGo for concealer and bronzers too. Add them in your makeup routine, to hide blemishes and highlight the face features. Carry out yourself with pride!\n\nBlush\n\nIts a myth that dusky tone should stay away from blush. Never skip it. Instead use some shades like rose, deep orange and coral. Try to avoid shades like brown and beige, as they won’t suit you. With Dusky tones you have to be a little careful with color choices.\n\nGlossy Eyelids\n\nThe best way to highlight your eyes is to use glossy eyelids. Use a cream based eye shadow on your lids in coral, brown, or rose gold shade that will bring out the beauty of your beautiful dark eyes.\n\nLip Shade\n\nWhen you choose your lipstick, look for deep and dark colors.

But remember, Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” This stone of hope can be a powerful tool to help you overcome self-doubt and move forward.\n\n**Believe You Can**\n\nTheodore Roosevelt’s famous quote, “The credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by the dust and heat, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends them dearly for the good of the world,” reminds us that even the smallest actions can make a significant impact.\n\n**Practical Tips for Building Confidence**\n\n1. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your goals into manageable steps. Each small success builds your confidence and momentum.\n2. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Recognize that setbacks are part of the journey.\n3. **Seek Support**: Surround yourself with people who believe in you and encourage your growth. Whether it’s a mentor, a friend, or a community, having support can make all the difference.\n4. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small. This reinforces your belief in your abilities and motivates you to keep going.\n\n**Overcoming Stage Fear**\n\nOne personal example of overcoming stage fear is when I had to give a presentation at a conference. Initially, the thought of standing in front of a large audience was terrifying. However, I prepared thoroughly, practiced my speech multiple times, and visualized a successful presentation. On the day of the presentation, I focused on the message I wanted to convey and the impact I wanted to make. By the end, I felt a sense of accomplishment and a newfound confidence in my abilities.\n\n**Inspiring Others by Solving Real-World Problems**\n\nInspiring others by solving real-world problems can be incredibly motivating. When you see the positive impact of your work, it reinforces your belief in your capabilities and fuels your own motivation. Whether it’s through your professional endeavors or personal projects, the satisfaction of making a difference can be a powerful source of inspiration.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to add any additional details or examples that resonate with you. This article should help you stay inspired and confident, even when facing self-doubt.\n</response>", "gts": "“Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.” -Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nPhoto by Cristofer Maximilian on Unsplash\n\nInspiration-\n\nIn life we all have to dream big and try to fulfilled it we took some efforts. But so many people have faced this problem that they can not keep themselves inspired, motivated because lack of self confidence, self-doubt, lack of conversation, and many more reasons. To get detail into this concept first we have understand what actually means to get inspire. The inspiration is thing which motivates you to make believe in yourself.\n\nWhen you started believing yourself this becomes the first step towards to get inspired. By analyzing successful people’s story they also started their journey by believing themselves. No matter who you are? where are you from? the only thing matters is your confidence, skills, and self trust.\n\nTo build up this you have make a plan or schedule to improve your qualities, watch some successful persons story, try to analyze your positive points write it down a paper or make dairy, make a proper conversation with professionals, etc.\n\nSome years ago, When I have to attend my presentation at that time I have a lot of stage fear, but when I learned to keep inspired, keep motivating myself at that moment I realized that there is nothing more than to keep yourself active and inspired. Once a great person said that,\n\n“Believe you can and you are halfway there.”-Theodore Roosevelt\n\nPhoto by carolyn christine on Unsplash\n\nSometimes you have to shortlist what or which things makes you inspired, keeps you disciplined. Explore what real world problems are faced by peoples. Once you have summarized all this note the weaknesses of this and start inspiring those peoples, make them explorable, innovative, and motivated.\n\nAt moment when you start to Dream big, pull yourself to achieve your dreams, build-up yourself like a big mountain whose never feels fear about the big challenges, always ready to gear-up the journey, and having the big dreams.

A study conducted by blockchain.com revealed that of the total distribution of 21 million Bitcoins, 18.89 million have already been mined and distributed to the market. The milestone comes almost 12 years after the first block, which consisted of 50 Bitcoins, was dug on January 9, 2009.\n\nBitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto has set the value of Bitcoin at 21 million, making cryptocurrency scarce for controlling inflation that may result from the unlimited supply.

After making a successful transaction set, the miner is rewarded with a Bitcoins block.\n\nIt should be noted that every four years the value of Bitcoin mining is being halved. So, when Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the reward for securing a block of transactions was 50 Bitcoins.

Miners will start to earn more from the transactions that take place on these blockchains than the mines themselves.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Bitcoin is not just a cryptocurrency, but a blockchain network that processes transactions in a distributed platform.

They help dentists detect problems early, such as cavities, tooth decay, and even issues with your jaw and sinuses. While dental X-rays are safe, there are some important considerations, especially for kids and pregnant patients.\n\n**What Are Dental X-rays?**\n\nDental X-rays are a series of images taken by a dentist to examine your teeth and mouth. They use a small amount of radiation to create detailed images of your teeth, bones, and soft tissues. These images allow dentists to identify potential issues that might not be visible during a regular check-up.\n\n**How Do Dental X-rays Work?**\n\nDental X-rays work by exposing a small area of your mouth to a controlled amount of radiation. The radiation is absorbed by the tissues in your mouth, creating a digital image that can be viewed on a computer screen. Dentists can then analyze these images to diagnose and treat various dental problems.\n\n**Why Are Dental X-rays Important?**\n\nDental X-rays are crucial for maintaining good oral health. They help dentists detect problems early, such as cavities, tooth decay, and even issues with your jaw and sinuses. By catching these issues early, dentists can provide prompt treatment, which can prevent more serious problems from developing.\n\n**Safety Concerns**\n\nWhile dental X-rays are safe, there are some safety considerations, especially for kids and pregnant patients. Digital X-rays are generally considered safer than traditional X-rays because they use less radiation. However, it's still important to follow the dentist's instructions to minimize exposure.\n\n**Myth: Kids Need X-rays Unnecessarily**\n\nOne common myth is that kids need X-rays every time they visit the dentist. This is not true. Kids typically only need X-rays if they have a dental problem or if the dentist recommends them. Regular check-ups and good oral hygiene are the best ways to keep your child's teeth healthy.\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need any adjustments.\n</response>", "gts": "Dental X-Ray, also known as radiographs, help the dentist in diagnosing any flaw between and inside your teeth. It further helps them in visualizing the disease of teeth that can’t be seen with a simple oral exam.\n\nSuch an X-Ray is performed yearly to track the progress of dental treatment and condition of teeth and gums. Compared to adults, it is inevitable for children to have dental X-rays for monitoring the growth of adult teeth. Through this, a dentist will be able to give his judgment regarding pulling over the baby’s teeth to avoid any sort of complications.\n\nDental X-Ray can easily spot the trouble early in your teeth, gums, jaw, and mouth. Getting early treatment for such dental problems will alleviate pain and irritation. For Dental X-Ray, you can always reach out to us anytime.\n\nHow Does a Dental X-ray Work?\n\nDental X-Ray is often conducted during routine visits where it shows the crown portion of your teeth and finds out if any signs of decay. To conduct this X-Ray, a patient is asked to place a plate in between their teeth where the machine will be placed on either side of your face.\n\nSecondly, Panoramic x-rays are also a part of dental health treatment. It is taken from the outside of your mouth that gives a bigger and clear picture of the oral cavity. It also includes pictures of the sinus area and jawbones to check if there’s any oral disorder.\n\nMost importantly, these X Rays are safe and emit quite a lower level of radiation.\n\nWhich are the key problems that dental X-Ray detects?\n\nDental X Rays can detect-\n\n• Reveal bone loss or any infection in the bone\n\n• Infection in the small areas between the teeth\n\n• Helps in suggesting for dentures, braces, tooth implants, or any other dental procedure\n\n• Reveal abnormalities like cysts and tumor\n\n• Check if there’s enough space for new teeth fitting\n\nBook an appointment for Dental X-Ray and maintain your oral hygiene under the guidance of professionals!", "score": 0.787727646144907, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7877276539802551, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.43941003137347967, "llm_reward": 0.787727646144907, "utility": 0.5883327542354674, "reward_gap": 0.3483176147714273, "source": "medium"}

DareNFT has developed a suite of products to address some of the challenges in the NFT landscape, including unrecognized benefits between NFTs, unrecognized relationships between NFT owners and hidden risks of NFT ownership. There are many content types out there and whereas the content types matter at application level, the licensing protocol layer is the same for all of them. Therefore, there is only one protocol needed to serve all.\n\nThe existing licencing processes of derivative content are mostly manual and time consuming. With an NFT 2.0 smart contract, these processes can be automated. Derivative content such as: song remixes, subtitled videos, edited images, learning contents, translated book often generates revenue from the rental and subscription business model. Creators can receive royalties from reproducer’s revenue via the NFT smart contract. This speeds up collaboration and sharing of benefits between the author and re-publisher, resulting in more income for both parties.\n\nThe advent of the NFT 2.0 protocol that DareNFT proposes can mark a new milestone for nonfungible tokens and the crypto market in general. The platform’s competitive advantage is its ability to adapt to emerging trends, banking on its NFT 2.0 protocol which is an essential element for building a thriving platform.\n\nDareNFT will provide InPoker with the access to its ecosystem and the NFT marketplace where InPoker plans to list some of the Elite NFT membership cards.

Here are the top 5 health benefits of cosmetic dentistry for Missouri City residents:\n\n1. **Preventing gum disease through corrected alignment**: Corrected alignment can reduce the risk of gum disease by improving the health of your gums. For example, crooked teeth can trap food and plaque, leading to inflammation and infection.\n\n2. **Improved digestion from better bite function**: A proper bite helps in better digestion. Misaligned teeth can cause you to chew food unevenly, leading to digestive issues.\n\n3. **Reduced risk of tooth decay via fissure sealing**: Fissure sealing is a procedure that prevents tooth decay by sealing the grooves in your back teeth. This is especially important for children and adults with deep grooves that are hard to clean.\n\n4. **Enhanced speech clarity**: Misaligned teeth can affect your speech. Correcting alignment can improve your ability to speak clearly and confidently.\n\n5. **Long-term oral health maintenance**: Regular dental check-ups and cosmetic treatments can help maintain your oral health over time. This includes regular cleanings, fluoride treatments, and sealants.\n\nIs this information clear and relatable for your audience?

These updates have not only redefined the competitive landscape but also brought a renewed focus on inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe VCT, now in its second season, has introduced a three-tier system that caters to a broader audience, from casual players to competitive pros. This tiered structure allows for a more inclusive environment where players of all skill levels can participate and grow. The first tier, featuring the top teams from the previous season, provides a platform for established stars to showcase their skills. The second tier, composed of teams from the VCT Qualifiers, offers a pathway for talented newcomers to compete at a high level. Finally, the third tier, comprising teams from the Game Changers tournament, ensures that the competition remains dynamic and exciting.\n\nThe Game Changers tournament, introduced in the second season, has been a game-changer for Valorant’s competitive scene. This tournament is designed to promote diversity and inclusivity by featuring teams from various regions and backgrounds. It has been instrumental in bringing together players from different parts of the world, fostering a sense of community and encouraging cross-cultural collaboration. The tournament’s success has not only increased Valorant’s global appeal but has also set a new standard for inclusive competition.\n\nInclusivity is a cornerstone of the Game Changers tournament, and its impact extends beyond the tournament itself. By providing opportunities for underrepresented groups, the tournament has helped to level the playing field and create a more equitable environment for all players. This inclusivity is crucial for the long-term growth and sustainability of the competitive scene.\n\nThe VCT’s tiered structure and the Game Changers tournament’s focus on diversity have not only improved the competitive experience but have also made Valorant more accessible to a wider audience. These changes have been well-received by both casual and competitive fans alike, as they have contributed to a more engaging and inclusive gaming community.\n\n---\n\nI hope this meets your expectations.

Through this research, the folks at Zone Diet have managed to find a way to make your body use the food to its fullest advantage and make you lose weight. The Zone Diet is gaining wide spread acceptance as a true form of weight loss and anything but a fad diet.\n\nDr. Sears is the man responsible for the Zone Diet and all of its inner workings. For years he has studied the effects that certain foods have on the bodies fat burning potential. With this research he has found the formula of foods and drinks that actually spur the body into over drive and help it to burn off the unnecessary fat and make you lose weight.\n\nThe Zone Diet is nothing like the other starvation diets that have come down the pike. In most cases you do not have to give up the foods that you love, but simply make adjustments in the daily regimen. This all speaks to the unique way that the Zone Diet works. Instead of cutting out the meals the Zone Diet adds two additional meals to the daily routine.\n\nThe Zone Diet works to stabilize and increase the insulin output of the body. With this insulin the body can more readily burn the fat to make certain that you are losing weight. This diet does not work in miracles or days even. There is a standard amount of time that you will need to work to make sure that you have maintained the proper procedures in the diet. This will help to build the bodies natural defenses against weight gain. With this manner you will be training your body to accept and decline certain foods in order to keep the weight that you lose off.\n\nThe Zone Diet is being actively referred to as the diet of the stars. Many of those in Hollywood and surrounding areas have found that the Zone Diet is vastly superior to the other diets currently on the market and therefore increasing its popularity to new levels.\n\nThis post contains affilliate links.If you use these links to buy something we may earn commission.thanks", "score": 0.7519459366211634, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7519459128379822, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.17966683793290988, "llm_reward": 0.7519459366211634, "utility": 0.36755917717998104, "reward_gap": 0.5722790986882536, "source": "medium"}

Then it must target your personal symptoms, which will have endless permutations of the major and common symptoms. Only this personal approach can come even close to a cure. Everything else is simply suppressing the cause or dealing with the effect.\n\nA cure must, by definition, be temporary treatment. Providing you with the strength to push through and manage on your own.\n\nBefore looking at what natural modalities can achieve this, there is one area of natural health care than has and is also curing diabetes, in animals as well as people.\n\nDiet.\n\nThe old saying of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ couldn’t be more true for health. Eat processed food or a diet which is essentially nutrient poor, and how can you expect your health to be good? Or, to put it another way, if you put diesel in your unleaded vehicle, would you expect it to run at all, let alone well?\n\nWhy is the area of your local supermarket that sells fresh fruit and vegetables quite a small area in comparison with the rest of the store? Because people don’t buy enough! A recent survey came to the worrying conclusion that about 80% of the food bought in a typical western country was processed.\n\nYet a recent study discovered that when people ate a totally raw diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, not only did their diabetes reduce, IT VANISHED COMPLETELY. After this diet for only one month, all the long term users of insulin no longer needed it.\n\nSo diet is essential to your good health and if you have diabetes, this is an area that you must address first, to get any results.\n\nBut let’s go back to the modality of health care that can cure diabetes discussed earlier. The natural and perhaps unique approach which personalises your cause, your symptoms is homeopathy.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is a safe, powerful yet gentle modality of complete and natural health care. Homeopathy is a way of life, rather than a ‘quick fix’ type of health care. By supporting your homeopathic treatment with a natural diet, regular exercise, optimum sleep, natural exposure to the sun on bare skin, time for you, time to relax, you can expect to have the best of health.\n\nYou can, in addition to professional homeopathic help, learn to use the common remedies at home, treating those common injuries and ailments that happen to even the best regulated families.\n\nDo try it once.", "score": 0.779917533760747, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7799175381660461, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3245254425053488, "llm_reward": 0.779917533760747, "utility": 0.5030935129390824, "reward_gap": 0.4553920912553982, "source": "medium"}

In this article, let’s take a look at the 6 best ways that work out better for your home.\n\nBasic Needs Come First\n\nPrioritize all the products and make a list. Prepare the needs list first and include the wants later. This helps reduce your budget and if you really have more affordability, you may land in with all the goods. Kitchen table, chairs, beds, couches are the most common requirements for any home.\n\nPay Attention To Seasonal Sales\n\nFurniture Deals seriously help you run through the budget constraints while furnishing your home. Users find few overloaded stock that’s not completely sold at comparatively lower prices while you may be wondering at how the seasonal sales happen.\n\nStore Credit Cards Can Be Helpful\n\nThe perfect use of paying credit in time with 0% interest can be really helpful while the stores themselves help you in providing such zero interest credit cards. But the tricky part lies when you are not paying the credit amount in time. Then the whole amount that’s billed over the furnishings would be charged with an interest.\n\nPlan Perfectly\n\nKeep a close watch on all the spaces at the home you purchase or want to walk-in. Never let a misplacement or shortage of furnishings break the beauty of your home. Plan accordingly and especially in a way that the products including beds, and sofa chairs fit right into the spaces.\n\nPrefer Secondhand Goods\n\nIt’s not possible to afford higher prices for furnishing your home and particularly with all families. So furnishing your home at affordable cost with Sofa Deals and other existing offers is a possibility. This of course happens most of the time when you have no objection towards purchasing the second hand goods.\n\nFix Home Decoration Budget\n\nBeyond going with the lighting & decoration part, an average affordable family can go with the limited styling to the home while the affluent families can go well ahead. Of course decorating a new home is every one’s wish.

However, integrating this feature can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex UI elements. This article aims to simplify the process of implementing drag and drop functionality in Android apps, focusing on the **DragAndDrop** library, which is currently in **alpha**.\n\nThe **DragAndDrop** library simplifies the implementation of drag and drop functionality by providing a straightforward API. However, it's important to note that the library is still in its early stages and may not be fully optimized. Therefore, it's recommended that developers try the alpha version and provide feedback to help improve the library.\n\nTo get started, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add the Dependency**: Add the following dependency to your app's `build.gradle` file:\n   ```gradle\n   implementation 'com.example:draganddrop:1.0.0-alpha'\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Source View**: Create a `SourceView` class that extends `DragSource`. This class will handle the drag and drop operations.\n\n3. **Create a Target View**: Create a `TargetView` class that extends `DragTarget`.

This gesture is usually a long press on touch screens or a click and drag when using a mouse.\n\nA simple drag & drop sample.\n\nWhile Android has long supported drag and drop ( DragEvent was introduced in Android 3.0, API level 11), integrating full support for handling gestures, events, permissions and callbacks has proven to be complex.\n\nToday we’re introducing the Jetpack DragAndDrop library as an alpha release to make it easier for you to handle data dropped into your app.\n\nDrag and drop is becoming increasingly relevant for large screen form factors: tablet and laptops, but especially also foldables, where split screen is used 7 times as often than on conventional phones. The ability to drag data from one app to another is a natural experience for users as they multitask more efficiently with their apps in split-screen or windowed modes.\n\nWhile dragging text from EditTexts is supported natively by the platform, we strongly recommend enabling users to drag any images, files or text from other components of your app. Just as importantly, we encourage allowing users to drop data into your apps as well.\n\nDragging from one app into another.\n\nDropHelper , in combination with DragStartHelper , makes it much easier to take care of gesture support, callbacks, styling and pixel-perfect alignment.\n\nDragStartHelper\n\nDragStartHelper is a utility class in Jetpack core that detects gestures commonly used to start a drag, such as long pressing or click and dragging with a mouse.\n\nDropHelper\n\nThe new DropHelper is a utility class that takes care of listeners and drop targets. Be sure to use addInnerEditTexts() when building DropHelper.Options to ensure that any nested EditTexts inside your drop target don’t acquire focus instead.\n\nLearn more\n\nRead more in the Drag and drop guide on Android Developers, dive into the large screen sample to see DropHelper in practice and then try it out in alpha now to give us feedback.\n\nThanks to Florina, Ben and Nick!", "score": 0.6959850233418454, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6959850192070007, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3592577550980867, "llm_reward": 0.6959850233418454, "utility": 0.5000380156224933, "reward_gap": 0.3367272682437587, "source": "medium"}

Here are some practical, cost-saving DIY tips using household items like vinegar, baking soda, and more:\n\n1. **Vinegar and Baking Soda**:\n   - Mix equal parts white vinegar and baking soda to create a paste. Apply this paste to stains and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Scrub gently with a brush and rinse with water. This method is effective for removing grease, grime, and mildew.\n\n2. **Baking Soda and Water**:\n   - Create a paste with baking soda and water. Use this paste to scrub surfaces, especially in bathrooms and kitchens. Baking soda is excellent for removing soap scum, lime scale, and other mineral deposits.\n\n3. **White Vinegar**:\n   - For tough stains, apply white vinegar directly to the affected area. Let it sit for a few minutes, then scrub with a brush. Vinegar is great for removing mold and mildew, especially in hard-to-reach areas.\n\n4. **Hydrogen Peroxide**:\n   - Use hydrogen peroxide to clean glass and mirrors. It’s effective for removing fingerprints and streaks. Apply it with a cloth and wipe clean.\n\n5. **Microfiber Cloths**:\n   - Use microfiber cloths to clean surfaces. They are gentle on surfaces and can be reused multiple times. Microfiber cloths are especially useful for dusting and polishing.\n\n6. **Rubbing Alcohol**:\n   - For cleaning electronic devices, use rubbing alcohol. It’s effective for removing fingerprints and other residues. Be cautious when using on sensitive electronics.\n\n7. **Essential Oils**:\n   - Add a few drops of essential oils like tea tree or lavender to a mixture of water and vinegar. This can help disinfect surfaces and leave a pleasant scent.\n\nBy using these household items, you can save money while keeping your bond clean and your rental property in top condition. Remember to always test any cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the surface.\n\nFor specific DIY tips tailored to your region (Adelaide/Gold Coast), feel free to ask for more detailed advice.\n</response>", "gts": "The most important chore at the end is bond cleaning.

By providing immediate access to financial information, real-time data helps stakeholders make informed decisions quickly. This section will explore how real-time data enhances accountability and the role of nonprofit accounting software in ensuring compliance with GAAP and FASB standards.\n\nFirst, real-time data allows for continuous monitoring of financial transactions, which is essential for detecting and addressing any discrepancies promptly. This proactive approach ensures that financial reports are accurate and reliable, fostering trust among stakeholders. For instance, real-time data can reveal unusual spending patterns or revenue fluctuations, prompting immediate investigation and corrective action.\n\nSecond, real-time data facilitates better decision-making by providing up-to-date financial information. Nonprofit organizations can use this data to allocate resources more effectively, optimize fundraising efforts, and respond to changing market conditions. By having real-time visibility into financial performance, organizations can make data-driven decisions that align with their mission and goals.\n\nThird, real-time data supports compliance with GAAP and FASB standards. Nonprofit accounting software often includes features that automatically generate financial reports in compliance with these standards. This automation reduces the risk of errors and ensures that financial statements are accurate and complete. Additionally, real-time data helps organizations stay current with regulatory changes, ensuring ongoing compliance.\n\nIn conclusion, real-time data is a powerful tool for enhancing accountability in nonprofit accounting software. By providing immediate access to financial information, organizations can maintain transparency, make informed decisions, and ensure compliance with financial regulations.\n\nAs for the outline, it currently fits within 500 words. If you feel any part can be trimmed, please let me know, and I can make the necessary adjustments.\n</response>", "gts": "Nonprofits and government agencies need nonprofit accounting software to demonstrate accountability and compliance. Let’s take a deep dive into what you need to know in choosing the most compliant software.\n\nA compliant nonprofit accounting software system tracks revenue to a designated purpose and prevents misuse of donations.\n\nIf a nonprofit wants to be compliant with GAAP and FASB 116/117, all of their funds must be grouped into two categories of net assets: (1) without donor restrictions and (2) net assets with donor restrictions, which replace the three former categories of unrestricted, temporarily restricted and permanently restricted net assets. To be GAAP-compliant, nonprofits only need two funds to report on the breakdown of net assets on IRS form 990.\n\nNonprofit Accounting Software Identifies Who, What and Why\n\nIn order to fully understand why nonprofits need nonprofit accounting, you need to understand three fundamental questions:\n\nWho is the source of revenue? What is the designated purpose? Why nonprofits need to classify revenue?\n\n1. Who is the source of revenue?\n\nWho identifies the source of revenue and provider of services and expenses.

Here’s a draft for a short article about blockchain and cryptocurrencies in India, focusing on land record management and welfare distribution:\n\n---\n\n**Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies in India: Breaking Down Myths and Enhancing Transparency**\n\nBlockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including land record management and welfare distribution. In India, these areas often suffer from significant issues of corruption and inefficiency. By leveraging blockchain, we can significantly reduce fraud and ensure transparency.\n\n**Land Record Management**\n\nLand records are a critical aspect of any country's governance. In India, land records are prone to corruption, leading to disputes and inefficiencies. Blockchain can help by providing a tamper-proof ledger that ensures all transactions are recorded and verified. This not only prevents fraud but also ensures that all stakeholders have access to accurate and up-to-date information. For example, when a land transaction occurs, the blockchain can automatically update the records, reducing the need for manual verification and minimizing the chances of errors.\n\n**Welfare Distribution**\n\nWelfare schemes in India often face issues of corruption and inefficiency, leading to the misallocation of funds. Blockchain can help by creating a transparent and secure system for distributing welfare benefits. By integrating blockchain with existing welfare schemes, we can ensure that funds are allocated directly to beneficiaries, reducing the risk of corruption. For instance, when a welfare benefit is issued, the blockchain can track the transaction from the government to the beneficiary, ensuring that the funds reach the intended recipients.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to add any specific details or examples to these points?\n</response>", "gts": "But but blockchain is for criminals…\n\nToo many times have we heard this argument. It is almost a meme by now. It is a bit true, but also a lot wrong. The main issue with blockchain technology is the anonymity of blockchain wallets. Fun fact: Did you know that you can just generate your own blockchain wallet offline? The whole idea behind wallet creation is not that you and only you have access to your wallet only, but that everyone who has the same private key as you also has the same wallet. The “security” only stems from one aspect: Stochastics! Two people have a very very low chance to create the same wallet. For example, MetaMask creates them using 2048 seed words. In total, you need 12 of them to create a wallet. Therefore, there are 204⁸¹² possibilities. Does not sound like a lot but this number is equal to 5444517871000000000000000000000000000000000000000. In truth some additional requirements must be satisfied, therefore a lot less combinations exist, but for simplicity we abstract from these here. All of these wallets are therefore entirely anonymous. The only way to know who has access to which address is by creating a mapping between a person’s real identity and the wallet address they have used for a transaction. Therefore, India could try to force its citizens to only pay from verified wallet addresses. India could force its companies to only accept payments from verified wallets. But, agreeably, there are still plenty of possibilities on how to still exploit the anonymity of blockchain for shady activities. There’s one crucial aspect to the blockchain though: It keeps a log of every transaction ever executed forever, redundantly backed up on thousands or even millions of servers worldwide. Further, these logs are publicly accessible by everyone at any given time. Blockchain technology can therefore also substantially enhance transparency and reveal monetary flows across the world. It acts as an ultimate threat: Yes, you can engage in illegal transactions, but should your wallet address ever become traceable back to you, even if only by accident, everyone can see what you’ve done. Therefore, India should not ban “private” (i.e.. “decentralized”) blockchains, but rather embrace them and build systems around them to enhance both their transparency and security.", "score": 0.781782927277631, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7817829251289368, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3524414725221438, "llm_reward": 0.781782927277631, "utility": 0.5249121127221207, "reward_gap": 0.4293414547554872, "source": "medium"}

Just as a bettor risks losing their stake, a cosigner risks losing their financial assets if the borrower defaults. One predictable risk is wage garnishment, where creditors can legally seize a cosigner's wages to cover unpaid debts. This can lead to severe financial strain and even bankruptcy for the cosigner.\n\nFinancial implications are significant. If the borrower defaults, the cosigner is liable for the full amount, potentially leading to wage garnishment, tax refunds being seized, and damage to credit scores.

Particularly loved the \"Little Little\" sequence in the movie. Imo, the best 10 minutes in the movie.\n\nThe movie has equal shortcomings to that of the positives. The lack of engaging screenplay, irking logical loopholes, stereotyping tamils(though it's not new in a Bollywood movie, the entire Tamilnadu sequence was a turn off) and inadequate character background are some of the shortcomings of the movie. It's as if the director who wrote terrific first half didn't know how to end the movie in second half.\n\n~Overall, a decent movie that falls short in the latter half. Watch it for Dhanush and AR Rahman.\n\nP.S. : There is some serious ill handled mental issue concept that is sure to stir up arguments in the coming days. Dhanush being a doctor in the movie, it was baffling the way it was treated in the movie.", "score": 0.747324323027592, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7473243474960327, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.24107373297098889, "llm_reward": 0.747324323027592, "utility": 0.4244528999692177, "reward_gap": 0.5062505900566031, "source": "medium"}

Program", "gts": "DSP Technology for Middle-market Brands\n\nDSP Technology for Middle-market Brands\n\nBrittany Wray shares insights on programmatic advertising and its influence on marketing. She highlights the outcomes derived from the said technique creating a win-win situation for all. If you look at most leading indicators for programmatic digital advertising, the trends point steadily upwards with DSP Technology for Middle-market Brands. The latest forecast from eMarketer projects that marketers will spend more dollars on programmatic ($133B), that it will account for a greater share of the media mix (91%), and that a growing and increasingly premium share of available inventory will be transacted programmatically.\n\nIt’s Only Middlemen for The Middle Market — Major brands and agencies have long mastered the ins and outs of programmatic tech. Reading the industry trades, one could easily assume that the vast majority of advertisers have followed suit. The simple reason is that they don’t spend enough money on their own to meet the minimums for leading DSPs like MediaMath and The Trade Desk. These arbitrary minimums have excluded the majority of advertisers from the programmatic advertising technology.\n\nIt’s a lost opportunity for everyone. These budget minimums have limited the middle market’s autonomy and curtailed its ability to bring advertising operations under their own control. They have disincentivized these companies from developing the talent and budgeting the resources necessary to master this technology and get the most value from it. And they have kept the major DSPs from accessing the largest, most diversified, and therefore most durable segment of advertisers. Instead, middle market companies rely on media agencies (like my company, AudienceX) to manage their digital budgets, essentially acting as surrogate operators of this DSP technology. On the surface, that would seem to benefit digital agencies like us, but in the long run I’m not sure it benefits anyone.\n\nFor more such updates, check Out recent Martech Cube guest blogs.", "score": 0, "step": 10, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}
{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Hey, I need to write a short article about 3D printing and solar energy. Something on how they’re combining for greener tech. Keep it under 500 words. Can you help outline the key points?Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: This outline looks good, but can you add a specific example of how 3D printing is currently being used to produce solar panels (like the startup or community project you mentioned)? Also, let me know if this structure will keep the final article under 500 words.\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is clear and specific, so it's a DQ.\n- DA (direct answer)

is becoming the brand new norm in the power industry, and solar era is not an exception.\n\nThe power enterprise has been continually seeing crests of technological impact, and now additive production has sought the possibility to beautify the price of renewable power. 3-d revealed solar panels are actually becoming an important asset to the strength industry. For the reason that global is shifting faraway from ways that boom carbon footprints, 3D printed solar panels are laying the path for the converge of green technologies to take location.\n\n3 D printing is one of the nice strategies to provide large portions of solar panels in a totally small amount of time. This digital production concept now not best reduce costs however ensures the enhanced high-quality of the product as nicely. By means of adopting the concept of 3D printing and imposing this method to generate sun panels, the sun electricity organizations are revel in excessive-earnings values and set up a promising and reliable solar energy era technique for each business and home functions.\n\nAs stated in advance, 3-D printing is understood for its rapid creation of merchandise, and for this reason, this method allows the strength enterprise reap prototypes desires faster than ever at the bottom prices. This approach also permits clean modeling and reworking of the 3D published solar panels. This way, this approach improves the first-class and quantity of the production of sun panels.\n\nSeeing that 3-D printing is an issue of additive production, solar electricity companies can produce sun panel prototypes and set of final merchandise in good sized volumes and contact for batch processing, testing, and implementation capabilities without difficulty. This guarantees the fulfillment of the enterprise’s production goals to a very large volume. 3-D printing technology helps dynamic iterations whilst prototyping and therefore realise the walk of the sun strength realm toward the green energy revolution.\n\nCheck Out This :\n\nLearns More : Energy business review", "score": 0.6001002940724994, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6001002788543701, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.09928637242255875, "llm_reward": 0.6001002940724994, "utility": 0.2440937960870149, "reward_gap": 0.5008139216499407, "source": "medium"}

Jim has managed to construct for himself a perfect life in the world’s most expensive city. Curiously, when Jim is unexpectedly laid off, he desperately clings onto the symbols of his success. Not long thereafter, plauged by his past, we find Jim wrestling with resurfacing demons.\n\nRepossession, frequently compared to Jordan Peele’s Get Out (2017) and Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite (2019), stars Gerald Chew as Jim. Chew’s previous work includes The Tattooist (2007), Apprentice (2016), and Wonder Boy (2017). More recently, playing Tommy ‘The Scorpion’ Chow, the actor could be seen in the Dean Devlin/Gary Rosen co-created television series Almost Paradise.\n\nVideo Credit: Cinequest\n\nFurther to Chew, playing supporting characters, Repossession also stars Amy Cheng, Sivakumar Palakrishnan, Rachel Wan, Matthew Loo, Ming Siu Goh, and Scott C.

Security concerns are another major issue, with the potential for cyber attacks and money laundering.

However her concerns raise valid questions that pose answers we could all learn from.\n\nUnderstanding the technology behind crypto is critical to making smarter investment decisions. Become a blockchain ninja today!\n\nTraditional Currencies Will Suffer\n\nOne of Hillary’s main concerns were that cryptocurrency will eventually become too widespread. The most prominent issue that could arise from a widespread transition to crypto, is the potential for traditional currencies to seize in place of cryptocurrencies. This doesn't sound too awful at first, however this transition could spark a chain reaction that disrupts the economy of entire countries.\n\nEconomies Will Suffer\n\nThe problem becomes much more serious, if in theory cryptocurrency effectively becomes the norm putting traditional currencies in the back seat. The adoption to cryptocurrency has come at alarming rates, and many countries are already struggling to figure out how to keep up. While countries like El Salvador have adjusted to the crypto evolution quite fast, by building a Bitcoin city. Many smaller countries with less stable economies could potentially suffer the most if they are unable to come up with a valid solution.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nMany people fear that having large portions of a country’s wealth stored in crypto could be a security risk for getting hacked. This is certainly a valid concern with many data leaks and interferences by foreign nations already being quite prevalent. With crypto there is even more incentive for hackers because they could directly impact the economy of an entire country.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is difficult to say which concerns are the most valid, and what issues deserve the most attention. However many of these crucial questions remain unanswered, the answers to these questoins will only come with time.\n\nOne More Thing\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider following me on Twitter: @natexlee.", "score": 0.6439456822872711, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6439456939697266, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.2032544241017063, "llm_reward": 0.6439456822872711, "utility": 0.361780055843436, "reward_gap": 0.4406912581855648, "source": "medium"}

This feature is currently in a US-only beta phase, offering instant transactions, no fees, and seamless integration with chats.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Instant Transactions:** Users can send and receive funds instantly, enhancing the user experience.\n- **No Fees:** The feature eliminates transaction fees, making it more accessible to a broader user base.\n- **Direct Chat Integration:** Funds can be sent directly within WhatsApp chats, streamlining the process.\n\n**Novi’s Role:**\nNovi provides the wallet infrastructure and ensures regulatory compliance, ensuring the feature operates within legal boundaries. This partnership leverages Novi’s expertise in wallet technology and regulatory compliance to facilitate safe and secure transactions.\n\n**Background:**\nThis new feature replaces Diem/Facebook’s previous crypto project, which faced significant regulatory hurdles. The shift to USDP and Novi’s involvement marks a new phase in WhatsApp’s crypto strategy, focusing on stability and user-friendliness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhatsApp’s new crypto payment feature represents a significant step forward in integrating blockchain technology into everyday communication. With instant transactions, no fees, and seamless chat integration, users can now send and receive funds more efficiently. The partnership with Novi and the use of USDP (USDP by Paxos) ensures a stable and secure environment for users.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts or ask for any additional details!\n</response>", "gts": "WhatsApp has announced the introduction of a payment service based on the Novi wallet. Users will be able to send and receive USDP, a stablecoin from Paxos.\n\nWhatsApp launches cryptocurrency payment service\n\nAs a reminder, WhatsApp is part of the Meta/Facebook group, so the integration of Novi is not particularly a surprise. The news was announced by Stephane Kasriel, the new CEO of Novi who replaces David Marcus, the latter having announced his departure a few days ago.\n\nThe Novi wallet, was developed in parallel with Diem, the cryptocurrency initially carried by Facebook. But it is the wallet that seems to have taken center stage: it was launched six weeks ago and is based on USDP: a stablecoin from Paxos backed by the dollar. It, too, has changed its name — it was once called PAX.\n\nPayments in USDP directly from conversations\n\nThis is the payment solution that has just been integrated into WhatsApp, for users located in the United States. According to the official website of the project, they can now access the sending of funds directly from the conversation, as if they were sending an attachment.\n\nMoreover, there are no sending or receiving fees, and it is possible to transfer the amount to their bank account. According to the release, payments are sent instantly from one participant to another.\n\nStephane Kasriel confirmed that the functionality would eventually be opened to other countries:\n\n“The Novi pilot is still in its very early stages, so we made the decision to test this new entry point in one country to begin with, and we will expand it once we get feedback from users.”\n\nDiem is fading?\n\nThe shift in the payment service is now particularly visible. The cryptocurrency, which until recently was called Libra, keeps running into limitations. The regulators show their teeth as soon as Diem takes a step in its development, and this despite a calculated distancing from Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBefore leaving the project, David Marcus had stated that the company intended to offer Diem eventually, and to integrate it with Novi. The choice of Paxos’ USDT had indeed been a way to rely on an existing cryptocurrency, and therefore less likely to trigger an outcry.\n\nBut in reality, Diem seems to be off to a bad start, and one wonders if Meta will finally manage to spread this cryptocurrency, which has been mutating ever since its 2019 launch was announced.", "score": 0.6861013795236224, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6861013770103455, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3543568223620034, "llm_reward": 0.6861013795236224, "utility": 0.49307677360242563, "reward_gap": 0.331744557161619, "source": "medium"}

It offers robust tools for job postings, company profiles, and networking events. For lead generation, LinkedIn can be leveraged through sponsored content, job postings, and company pages. For example, LinkedIn can be used to post job openings, which can attract a highly qualified candidate pool. Additionally, LinkedIn’s advanced analytics tools allow you to track the performance of your job postings and measure the effectiveness of your lead generation efforts.\n\n#### Instagram\nInstagram is a visual platform that is highly effective for lead generation through influencer collaborations and user-generated content. Instagram’s algorithm prioritizes content that is visually appealing and engaging, making it an ideal platform for showcasing products or services. Influencer collaborations on Instagram can be in the form of sponsored posts, where influencers promote your products or services in exchange for compensation. This can help increase brand awareness and drive traffic to your website. Additionally, Instagram’s Stories feature allows you to share quick updates and engage with your audience in real-time, which can be particularly effective for lead generation.\n\n#### TikTok\nTikTok is a short-form video platform that is gaining popularity for its ability to generate leads through user-generated content and influencer collaborations. TikTok’s algorithm prioritizes content that is entertaining and engaging, making it an ideal platform for showcasing your brand’s personality and values. Influencer collaborations on TikTok can be in the form of sponsored videos, where influencers create content that promotes your products or services. This can help increase brand visibility and drive traffic to your website. Additionally, TikTok’s community features allow you to engage with your audience and build a loyal following, which can be valuable for lead generation.\n\n### Influencer Collaborations\nInfluencer collaborations involve working with influencers to promote your products or services. This can take several forms, including sponsored posts, affiliate partnerships, and product reviews. Here’s a brief overview of each:\n\n- **Sponsored Posts**: Influencers create content that promotes your products or services in exchange for compensation. This can be in the form of a flat fee, a commission on sales, or a combination of both.\n- **Affiliate Partnerships**: Influencers promote your products or services in exchange for a commission on sales. This can be a great way to generate leads and increase sales.\n- **Product Reviews**: Influencers create content that reviews your products or services. This can be in the form of a video, a blog post, or a social media post. Influencers who have a large following can help increase the visibility of your products and drive traffic to your website.\n\nI hope this provides a clearer understanding of how Instagram and TikTok differ from LinkedIn in lead generation and what influencer collaborations look like in practice. Let me know if you need any further clarification or additional examples.\n</response>", "gts": "What is the best way to get leads online?\n\nHow do you get more sales leads online? Getting your business into the minds of potential customers, especially if you’re an e-commerce company, can be tricky — but not impossible. Here are 3 ways you can generate more sales leads online. 1) E-mail Marketing: Create an email list of people who want to hear from you, and start sending out emails on a regular basis with tips and advice that are relevant to their needs and interests. Just be sure not to abuse their inboxes!\n\n1) LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a great place to network and connect with other professionals. While you can use LinkedIn’s network to find new leads, as a marketing tool, it still leaves something to be desired in terms of ease of use. If you already have a personal profile on LinkedIn, there are a few tricks that you can use to make networking easier. Use these tips to get more out of your time on LinkedIn\n\n2) Google+\n\nWhile many businesses might think of social media as just a place to share pictures and updates, Google+ is so much more. Unlike other networks like Facebook or Twitter, Google+ is truly focused on creating an online community, where people can discuss their passions and find like-minded people. To create your ideal sales leads online, you must create content that’s valuable to these users and connect with them in ways that let them know you care about what they have to say.\n\n3) Facebook\n\nIf you have a Facebook page for your business, it’s a great idea to post frequently so that people stay up-to-date on new promotions or products. People will be more likely to buy from you if they trust that you are always offering new and exciting things, and since Facebook has become one of the most popular social media platforms in recent years, it’s a great way to gain exposure.\n\nGive-Aways For All The Affiliate Marketer:-|| $100 CPA For EVERY Person Who Enrolls In The One Funnel Away Challenge- That means, offering you 100% of the revenue when people upgrade to the challenge after registering.

We'll also cover the formulas used in these processes.\n\n#### Understanding the Light Grey Box\nThe 'light grey box' visual is a simple way to highlight important information. It appears when you hover over certain elements, such as buttons or sections, to draw attention to them. This visual cue helps users quickly identify what they need to do next.\n\n#### Button Logic\nThere is a single button for both confirming and adding. When you click this button, it performs the action you intended. For example, if you want to confirm a change, you click the button. If you want to add something, you also click the same button.\n\n#### Formulas Explained\nThe formulas used in these processes are straightforward. For the light grey box, the formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Highlight} = \\text{Hover} \\times \\text{Attention} \\]\nThis means that the more you hover over an element, the more attention it gets, making it stand out.\n\nFor the button logic, the formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Action} = \\text{Click} \\]\nThis means that clicking the button triggers the action you intended, whether it's confirming or adding.\n\n#### Conclusion\nBy following these simple steps, you can easily understand and use the 'light grey box' visual and the button logic for confirming and adding. This will make your interactions more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\n---\n\nThis article is under 500 words and clearly explains the 'light grey box' behavior, button logic, and formulas in simple terms. It should be suitable for your presentation tomorrow.\n</response>", "gts": "Filter on the name\n\nFiltering on the name goes via a controller; the type of filter inherently part of the table view.

The user's request is well-defined, so the LLM's effort is minimal, and the user's effort is moderate. The LLM's satisfaction is high, and the user's satisfaction is moderate. The token/compute cost is low, and the likelihood of success is high.\n</thinking>\n<payoff>\n{\n  \"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 2.0},\n  \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 1.0, \"user\": 2.5},\n  \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 3.0, \"user\": 2.0},\n  \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -2.0, \"user\": 1.0},\n  \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.5, \"user\": 1.5},\n  \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 1.5}\n}\n</payoff>\n<analyze>\nThe DQ_DA strategy offers the highest social welfare and user satisfaction.

As it had been over five years since I had taken a Spanish course I guess I really shouldn’t have been surprised right? Who can really expect to remember much from a high school course that was mediocre at best? As I tried desperately to order a simple sandwich and something to drink, I realized that if I didn’t at least attempt to learn Spanish I would most likely starve after a week or so.\n\nHow exactly does one go about learning Spanish in a Latin American country? Seems pretty easy right? Well, I assure you it is not, especially when your entire day is spent speaking English. Another obstacle that I quickly encountered was the very rapid way in which everyone speaks in this city. It is amazing how a sentence containing 10 words or so can come out sounding almost like one long word. Is that what English sounds like to people who don’t speak English? It is exceedingly difficult to learn words in another language when you are unable to decipher exactly where one word ends and another begins. This process is made even harder by the fact that most people here fail to pronounce the whole word anyway. There were many words that I was convinced I knew and was using quite frequently. Imagine my dismay when I found out they had whole other syllables on the end of the word. No wonder I had been getting funny looks from people on the street and in restaurants.\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that an actual course was needed or even better, a private tutor of some sort. The only way I was ever going to learn Spanish was by actually sitting down and studying with someone who could answer the myriad of questions that arose every day. Sad isn’t it? Here I sit, living in a Latin American country and I am unable to pick up the language without resorting to private lessons. Some people seem to have an ear for languages and can pick them up simply by listening, too bad I will never be one of those people.\n\nACCESS SPANISH LANGUAGE COURSES RIGHT NOW", "score": 0.47861141513229405, "step": 10, "reward": 0.47861140966415405, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.125, "user_reward": 0.12617305372167326, "llm_reward": 0.47861141513229405, "utility": 0.24573942254610473, "reward_gap": 0.3524383614106208, "source": "medium"}

Increasing physical activity\n\nThe more energy a person expends throughout the day, the more food they require as fuel.\n\nExercise aids in the depletion of glycogen stores in the body. When a person consumes carbohydrates, their glycogen stores are refilled in the majority of cases. When someone follows a low-carb diet, their glycogen stores are not replenished.\n\nIt may take some time for the body to adjust to relying on fat stores rather than glucose. As the body adjusts, a person may become tired.\n\n2. Significantly reducing carbohydrate intake\n\nKetosis occurs when the body is deprived of carbohydrates and must rely on fat for energy instead of sugar.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, lower your risk of heart disease, or maintain and control your blood sugar levels, you should limit your carb intake to 20 grams (g) per day or fewer.\n\nThis is not, however, a fixed figure. Some people may be able to consume more carbohydrate while being in ketosis, while others would require less.\n\n3. Fasting for short periods\n\nFasting, or going without eating for a period of time, can assist in achieving ketosis. Many people can fall into ketosis without eating anything.\n\nA doctor may recommend a lengthier fasting time of between 24 and 48 hours in specific regulated instances. Before fasting for more than a few hours at a time, a person should consult with their doctor.\n\nFat fasting is a different type of fasting. Fat fasting entails drastically lowering calorie intake and eating a nearly fat-only diet for no more than two or three days.\n\npreliminary research\n\nAccording to Trusted Source, this could help with weight loss. Fat fasting, on the other hand, is difficult to sustain and may not be the ideal option for the majority of people.\n\nPeople should be cautious about using this strategy because of the tiny sample sizes and lack of more substantial data.\n\nLearn Even More 4 Tips to Get into Ketosis By Clicking Here", "score": 0.5874547065198025, "step": 10, "reward": 0.5874547362327576, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.2608030033556362, "llm_reward": 0.5874547065198025, "utility": 0.39142042843439884, "reward_gap": 0.32665170316416625, "source": "medium"}

This significant market growth underscores the increasing demand for accurate and efficient translation services. In this article, we will compare three leading machine translation services: Google Translate, DeepL, and Microsoft Translator. We will focus on their market growth, the AI vs human translation debate, and a comparison of their tools.\n\n### Market Growth\n\nThe global machine translation market has seen substantial growth, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and the increasing need for multilingual communication. Google Translate, DeepL, and Microsoft Translator have all contributed to this growth, with each service offering unique features and capabilities.\n\n### AI vs Human Translation Debate\n\nThe debate between AI and human translation is complex and multifaceted. For simple texts, AI translation tools like Google Translate and DeepL are highly effective and can save time and resources. However, for complex texts, human translators often provide more accurate and nuanced translations. Businesses should consider the nature of the text and the level of accuracy required when deciding whether to prioritize AI or human translation.\n\n### Comparison of Tools\n\n#### Google Translate\n\nGoogle Translate is one of the most widely used machine translation services. It offers a user-friendly interface and supports over 100 languages. Google Translate uses neural machine translation, which allows for more natural-sounding translations. However, for complex texts, the accuracy may not be as high as that of human translators.\n\n#### DeepL\n\nDeepL is a German-based translation service that uses a neural machine translation model. It is known for its high accuracy and natural-sounding translations. DeepL supports over 50 languages and offers a range of features, including a text-to-speech function. However, the service is not free, and the cost may be a consideration for some users.\n\n#### Microsoft Translator\n\nMicrosoft Translator is another popular machine translation service that uses a combination of neural machine translation and rule-based translation. It supports over 60 languages and offers a range of features, including a text-to-speech function and integration with other Microsoft products. Microsoft Translator is also not free, and the cost may be a consideration for some users.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Google Translate, DeepL, and Microsoft Translator are all excellent machine translation services. The choice between them depends on the nature of the text and the level of accuracy required. For simple texts, AI translation tools like Google Translate and DeepL are highly effective. For complex texts, human translators often provide more accurate and nuanced translations. Whether to prioritize AI or human translation should be based on the specific needs of the business.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments or additional information.\n</response>", "gts": "Whether you exchange messages with friends who speak different languages, shop online on international websites, or just need to translate the content for research purposes, the chances are, that in one way or another, you used machine translations at some point. In many cases, these tools are doing their jobs automatically, enabling you to communicate across borders by using foreign languages with confidence.\n\nAs we live in an interconnected world, the need for translation has increased exponentially. In the last 10 years, the global language services market has seen rapid growth, virtually doubling in size. In 2019, it was evaluated at $49.6 billion and it’s forecasting to reach $56.18 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nHowever, when comparing the number of words translated daily, you would see it grew that from an average rate of just 2.000 words almost fifty years ago to 10.000 words today. This increase is a result of using an extensive range of machine translation software and special tools that are available nowadays. Algorithms and artificial intelligence help to continuously improve machine translation and process quickly large volumes of text.\n\nBut the main question is:\n\nCan Artificial Intelligence replace completely human translation?\n\nWell, the answer is neither simple nor easy. When the text is simple and clear, machine translation services can replace human linguists and provide good translations immediately. But for the complex texts, translation of sensitive data, business communication, and other professional translations, artificial intelligence translation tools are not a good enough alternative to specialized human translators.\n\nBut as many people rely on translation tools, let’s take a closer look at several machine translation services, their benefits, and limitations.

Here’s an expanded version of the 'myths' section with the debunked idea that bras prevent sagging, a brief mention of men’s bras and cross-dressers, and a personal touch for Pi.An.Bl.:\n\n**Myths and Misconceptions**\n\nBras are often associated with preventing sagging, but this is a myth. While bras can provide support and shape, they do not prevent breast sagging. Breast tissue naturally loses elasticity over time, and gravity plays a significant role in sagging. However, wearing a well-fitted bra can help maintain a more youthful appearance by providing support and reducing the impact of gravity.\n\nMen also wear bras, and some cross-dressers use them for various reasons. For men, bras can be a form of comfort and support, especially during physical activities. For cross-dressers, bras can be a part of their personal style and comfort. Pi.An.Bl. offers live help and feels like a reliable 'safe place.' They understand the importance of cultural and aesthetic reasons for wearing bras and strive to provide personalized support to their customers.\n\n**Cultural and Aesthetic Reasons**\n\nBras are not just about support; they also play a role in cultural and aesthetic preferences. In many cultures, bras are associated with femininity and modesty. They can be a symbol of self-expression and personal style. For some, wearing a bra is a way to feel comfortable and confident, regardless of the cultural context. Pi.An.Bl. understands these nuances and offers a variety of styles to cater to different preferences and needs.\n\nI hope this expanded section meets your expectations.

They are used to manage petty cash transactions efficiently. The book typically includes entries for various types of expenses, categorized into 'Miscellaneous' and 'Remarks' columns. The 'Miscellaneous' column covers expenses that are not specifically categorized, while the 'Remarks' column is used for detailed notes on each transaction.\n\nThe 'Imprest amount' is the initial amount allocated to the petty cash fund. This amount is replenished periodically to cover ongoing expenses. For example, if the petty cash book starts with an imprest amount of $500, and the total expenses for the month are $450, the remaining $50 can be used for future transactions.\n\nWould you like more detailed examples of expenses that go into each column?\n\n</response>", "gts": "Petty Cash Book in Accounting -In every organization a Petty Cash Book is maintained by many small payments such as conveyance, cartage, postage, telegrams, and other expenses (collectively recorded under miscellaneous expenses) are made. These are generally repetitive in nature. If all these payments are handled by the cashier and are recorded in the main cash book, the procedure is found to be very cumbersome. The cashier may be overburdened, and the cash book may become very bulky.\n\nTo avoid this, large organizations normally appoint one more cashier (petty cashier) and maintain a separate cash book to record these transactions. Such a cash book maintained by the petty cashier is called a petty cash book in accounting.\n\nThe petty cashier works on the Imprest system. Under this system, a definite sum, say Rs. 2,000 is given to the petty cashier at the start of a particular period. This amount is called the imprest amount. The petty cashier goes on making all small payments out of this imprest amount and when he has spent the substantial portion of the imprest amount say Rs.1,780, he gets reimbursement of the quantity spent from the top cashier.\n\nIn the Petty Cash Book in Accounting payment side (credit) besides the first amount column. Each of the numbers columns is allotted for items of specific payments, which are commonest. The last amount column is designated as ‘Miscellaneous’ followed by a ‘Remarks’ column. In the miscellaneous column, those payments are recorded that a separate column doesn’t exist. In the ‘Remarks’ the character of payment is recorded. At the top of the amount, all amount columns are calculated. The total amount column l shows the entire amount spent and to be reimbursed. On the receipt (debit) side, there’s just one amount column. Columns for the date, voucher number, and particulars are common for both receipts and payments.\n\nPetty Cash Book\n\nFor more details please visit: https://www.manishco.com/petty-cash-book-in-accounting/", "score": 0.7526787187506003, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7526786923408508, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.2974502038575418, "llm_reward": 0.7526787187506003, "utility": 0.47316428260340976, "reward_gap": 0.45522851489305854, "source": "medium"}

Here’s a draft of your article on accounting for unearned revenue, focusing on subscriptions and prepaid services:\n\n**Accounting for Unearned Revenue: A Focus on Subscriptions and Prepaid Services**\n\nUnearned revenue, also known as deferred revenue, occurs when a company receives payment in advance for goods or services that will be provided in the future. This can be particularly relevant for businesses offering subscriptions or prepaid services. Understanding how to account for unearned revenue is crucial for maintaining accurate financial records and ensuring compliance with accounting standards.\n\n**Subscriptions and Prepaid Services**\n\nSubscriptions and prepaid services are common examples of unearned revenue. When a customer pays for a subscription, the company receives payment upfront but provides services over time. Similarly, prepaid services involve customers paying for services in advance, which the company then provides over a specified period.\n\n**Accounting for Unearned Revenue**\n\nTo account for unearned revenue, the company should recognize the revenue when the related services are provided. This ensures that the revenue is recognized in the period in which the service is performed, aligning with the matching principle of accrual accounting.\n\n**Examples: QuickBooks and Xero**\n\nQuickBooks and Xero are popular accounting software tools that can help manage unearned revenue. These tools allow businesses to track payments received in advance and recognize revenue as services are provided. By integrating these tools, businesses can streamline their accounting processes and ensure accurate financial reporting.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy understanding and properly accounting for unearned revenue, businesses can maintain accurate financial records and ensure compliance with accounting standards. Using tools like QuickBooks and Xero can further simplify the process and enhance financial management.\n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments or additional examples.\n</response>", "gts": "If your business offers customers the ability to prepay for services, the accounting process for your revenue gets an additional layer of complexity added to it.\n\nYour accounting treatment will vary slightly depending on the circumstances, but I will outline the basics below.\n\nSubscriptions\n\nIf you offer subscriptions to your customers, such as monthly yard maintenance, car washing, dog walking or if you operate a SaaS business, you fall into this category.\n\nLet’s make the assumption that you offer your customers the ability to prepay for a year’s worth of services. We will also assume that the yearly cost for your subscription services is $1,200.\n\nThe basic journal entry to record the cash sale is straight forward:\n\nDr. Cash $1,200\n\nCr. Deferred revenue $1,200\n\nYou’ll notice that this gets posted to Deferred Revenue, not your typical revenue account. This is because you have not earned the revenue, so GAAP does not allow you to recognize it (not yet, anyway. You will!). Note that Deferred Revenue is a liability account. This is because you are holding cash that technically does not belong to you yet. Think of it almost like a loan from your customer.\n\nAt the end of each month, after you have performed the service, you will get the recognize the proportional amount of the revenue. In our example of a yearly subscription, this will be 1/12th each month.\n\nThe monthly journal entry would be:\n\nDr. Deferred Revenue $100\n\nCr. Revenue $100\n\nWhat you are effectively doing is recognizing $100 worth of revenue and reducing your liability, Deferred Revenue.\n\nAt the end of the 12 months, you would have made 12 monthly entries totaling $1,200 hitting revenue and removing $1,200 from deferred revenue, leaving you with a $0 liability.\n\nYou can follow this process no matter how long the prepayment period. For instance, you can sell 3 years worth of services at once — you’d simply switch the period you recognize the revenue over 36 month instead of 12 month.\n\nStill have questions?

Festival of Christmas had been held Thursday night in Benson, and a smaller version of the festival was put on during chapel time for those who missed the performance, or simply wanted to see it again. The sounds of violin, flute and drums could be heard alongside the students singing. Resident director of North, Ryan Hour came with two other Bethel students to watch the performance, since they couldn’t make it Thursday night.\n\n“It’s so cool to see everyone using their gifts,” said Ryan Hour, resident director of North. “From the vocalists to the orchestra, it’s all very special.”\n\nStudents left Benson just as quickly as they arrived heading back to classes. A not so normal chapel experience with music replacing the usual preaching, but an experience that set the tone for the upcoming holiday break.\n\n“The overall feeling of this event was a wonderful Christmas time,” Mackenzie Wondra, junior at Bethel said.\n\nPhoto by Talia McWright\n\n“This whole production, this whole day, has just been beyond words,” — Karen, from Wisconsin.\n\nTraveling 362 miles from Kenosha Wisconsin, Karen and her family visited campus to see harpist Cathy Victorsen with the intention of buying her CDs, but stayed for the entire festival of Christmas performance, face covered in tears, moved by the students’ voices.

One key aspect is understanding the concept of \"hard sets.\" In this article, we'll explore the nuances of pushing to failure, the benefits of bodyweight exercises, and why you might want to consider a different approach.\n\n### Introduction\nStrength training is a cornerstone of any fitness regimen, and one of the most effective ways to build muscle and improve performance is through \"hard sets.\" These are sets where you push yourself to the brink of failure, ensuring that you're challenging your muscles and stimulating growth. However, the intensity of these sets can vary, and it's important to understand when and how to apply them.\n\n### Pushing to Failure\nPushing to failure is a common practice in strength training, but it's not always the best approach. While it can be effective for building muscle, it can also lead to overtraining and burnout. Instead, consider a more nuanced approach that balances intensity with recovery.\n\n### Bodyweight vs. Weights\nBodyweight exercises are a great way to build strength and endurance without the need for weights. They can be particularly effective for beginners or those looking to build foundational strength. However, they may not provide the same level of intensity as weight training.\n\n### The Benefits of Hard Sets\nHard sets can be incredibly effective for building muscle and improving strength. They force your muscles to work harder and can lead to greater gains in size and power. However, it's important to balance intensity with recovery to avoid overtraining.\n\n### When to Use Hard Sets\nHard sets are most effective when used strategically. For example, you might use them in a circuit where you alternate between bodyweight exercises and weight training. This allows you to maintain a high level of intensity while also giving your body time to recover.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn conclusion, while hard sets can be a powerful tool in your strength training arsenal, it's important to use them strategically. By understanding the benefits and drawbacks, you can create a more effective and sustainable workout plan. Remember to balance intensity with recovery, and don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches.\n\n---\n\nFor more information and to learn more about the book \"Muscle for Life,\" visit [www.legionathletics.com/muscle-for-life-book/](www.legionathletics.com/muscle-for-life-book/).

Here’s how it works in the program in my new book Muscle for Life:\n\nEnd all hard sets of bodyweight exercises 1 rep shy of muscle failure, which is the point where you fail to complete a rep. That is, continue hard sets of bodyweight exercises until you feel you have 0 good reps left in the tank.\n\nEnd all hard sets of machine, dumbbell, and barbell exercises 2 to 3 reps shy of muscle failure (1 to 2 good reps left).\n\nAnd how do you gauge this accurately and know how close you are to muscle failure?\n\nIt’s mostly a matter of trial and error, but once you get underway, you’ll quickly become attuned to how your form is holding up.\n\nAn easy way to develop this intuition is, as you’re approaching the end of a hard set, to ask yourself, “If I absolutely had to, how many more reps could I get with good form?”\n\nYour instinctive answer will often be accurate, especially as you become more experienced.\n\nWhy not go right up to the point of muscle failure?\n\nMostly because it’s unnecessary for gaining muscle and strength and increases the risk of injury. As our muscles become fatigued, we can lose the ability to feel what we’re doing with our body and think we’re maintaining good form when we’re not.\n\nSurprisingly, you’ve just learned one of the greatest “secrets” of successful strength training: knowing how hard to train in your workouts.\n\nMany people don’t work hard enough and wonder why nothing changes, and many others work too hard and wonder why they’re always stuck in a rut and hurting.\n\nYou now know how to thread this needle effectively.\n\nWant connect-the-dots simple beginner, intermediate, or advanced strength training programs that put this technique into effective use?\n\nClick the link below to pre-order Muscle for Life now:\n\n⇒ www.legionathletics.com/muscle-for-life-book/\n\nGo for it!\n\nP.S.

It can moisturize and strengthen your hair, making it less prone to breakage. However, excessive oil can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.\n\n**Myth 2: Trimming Prevents Hairfall**\nRegular trims can help remove split ends and damaged hair, which can prevent hair from breaking. This doesn’t directly prevent hairfall, but it keeps your hair healthy and looking its best.\n\n**Myth 3: Shampoo/Conditioner Rotation**\nShampooing and conditioning your hair regularly is important for maintaining its health. Shampoo removes dirt and oil, while conditioner nourishes and detangles your hair. Rotating between different shampoos and conditioners can help keep your hair looking and feeling fresh.\n\n**Myth 4: Split Ends**\nSplit ends are a sign of damaged hair, not hairfall. They can be trimmed off to prevent further damage, but they don’t directly cause hairfall. It’s important to address the underlying cause of hair damage, such as overprocessing or harsh treatments.\n\nI hope this helps!

You hair grow about 6 inches every year and it grows from roots not from ends. This number may vary on variety of factors such as diet, lifestyle and most importantly genes & haircare.\n\nTrimming is essentially important to maintain healthy hair free from any split ends and damage but that’s all. It has got Nothing to do with faster hair growth.\n\nMyth 3- You should change your shampoo & conditioner every few months.\n\nNo, shampoo is basically a cleanser which just cleanse your scalp. Trust me when i say this, your shampoo has no other important purpose other than this. If you change your shampoo every few months you may worsen your hair.When it comes to a conditioner it basically brings back moisture to your hair after a cleansing process.\n\nIt helps keep your length hydrated and more manageable. Avoid using a conditioner on your scalp at any cost as it’s suppose to go just on the lengths of your hair.\n\nMyth 4- Split ends can be repaired.\n\nNo they can never be repaired. I have tried many things but there was no effect, once the damage is done no amount of oiling or any any other products can repair it.\n\nIt’s like a permanent split in the shaft of your hair which can only be gotten rid of by cutting that end to expose the fresh and complete hair.\n\nI hope I have cleared some doubts (this is my view what I have experienced I may or may not be wrong)\n\nDo follow me on Instagram — https://www.instagram.com/rashiisharmaa/", "score": 0.7595087199977184, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7595087289810181, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.34674509290241656, "llm_reward": 0.7595087199977184, "utility": 0.5131821525304678, "reward_gap": 0.41276362709530184, "source": "medium"}

Here are some key matchups and betting picks:\n\n#### Key Matchups:\n1. **Quarterbacks:**\n   - **Vikings: Kirk Cousins** (TD prop: -110, pass yardage line: 200.5)\n   - **Bears: Justin Fields** (TD prop: -105, pass yardage line: 203.5)\n\n2. **Running Game:**\n   - **Vikings: Alexander Mattison** (TD prop: +110, pass yardage line: 100.5)\n   - **Bears: David Montgomery** (TD prop: +110, pass yardage line: 100.5)\n\n3. **Defense:**\n   - **Vikings: Bears’ secondary** (4 CBs and 3 safeties)\n   - **Bears: Vikings’ defense** (strong pass rush and run defense)\n\n#### Betting Picks:\n- **Over/Under:** Over 46.5 points\n- **Kirk Cousins TD prop:** +110\n- **Justin Fields pass yardage line:** +105\n\nFor DraftKings, sign up [HERE](https://www.draftkings.com/).\n\n### Secondary Information:\nThe Bears’ secondary does indeed have 4 cornerbacks and 3 safeties. This is a significant advantage, especially considering the Vikings’ passing attack. However, the Vikings’ defense is formidable, particularly in the pass rush.\n\nLet me know if you need more details!\n</response>", "gts": "Monday Night Football picks and preview at Soldier Field.\n\nThe COVID-depleted Bears will host their division rival Vikings tonight on Monday Night football and it appears to be an incredible mismatch on paper. The already banged up Bears defense will be without their top 4 CBs and top 3 safeties on the depth chart. Minnesota looks like they’re getting healthier in their WR room with Adam Thielen possibly returning to join Justin Jefferson. So let’s get to some picks. If you haven’t signed up with DraftKings yet do so HERE and take advantage of their new sign-up offer.\n\nOVER 46\n\nI really like the over here mainly because I think the Vikings can score ton. If Mike Zimmer lets his team throw on this depleted Bears secondary, the Vikings should be able to put up a whole lot of points through the air. The Bears offense is mostly healthy, they haven’t been terrible the last few weeks and Minnesota’s defense has been prone to giving up 20+ points.\n\nJustin Jefferson Anytime TD scorer (-105)\n\nThis one makes a whole lot of sense given the Bears secondary situation. Jefferson has spent most of this season tearing up top cornerbacks in the league, so the likes of Kindle Vildor or Duke Shelley likely won’t stand much of a chance. Not the greatest value but I like this at near even money.\n\nJustin Fields OVER 203.5 Pass Yards\n\nIf the Vikings are going to move the ball and put up points quickly, the Bears at some point will have to try and keep up. Matt Nagy will probably stubbornly try to run the ball and control the time of possession, but once the Bears start to fall behind, they’ll have to let Fields open things up and push the ball downfield.", "score": 0.6743066220998739, "step": 10, "reward": 0.6743066310882568, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.32306178334924346, "llm_reward": 0.6743066220998739, "utility": 0.46673622085690936, "reward_gap": 0.35124483875063045, "source": "medium"}

There are two main types: Type 1, where the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, and Type 2, where the body doesn’t use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps cells absorb glucose from the blood.\n\n**How the Body Processes Sugar**\n- When you eat, your body breaks down food into glucose.\n- Insulin helps glucose enter cells, where it’s used for energy.\n- If there’s too much insulin or not enough, glucose builds up in the blood, leading to high blood sugar levels.\n\n**Why Blood Sugar Control Matters**\n- High blood sugar can damage blood vessels and nerves.\n- It increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and eye damage.\n- Proper blood sugar control helps prevent these complications and keeps you healthy.\n\nDo you have any questions about this?\n</response>", "gts": "Diabetes? Why Did No One Tell You About This? (Smart Blood Sugar)\n\nDiabetes happens when your body isn’t able to take up sugar (glucose) into its cells and use it for energy. This results in a build up of extra sugar in your bloodstream.\n\nPoorly controlled diabetes can lead to serious consequences, causing damage to a wide range of your body’s organs and tissues — including your heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves.\n\nWhy is my blood glucose level high? How does this happen?\n\nThe process of digestion includes breaking down the food you eat into various different nutrient sources. When you eat carbohydrates (for example, bread, rice, pasta), your body breaks this down into sugar (glucose). When glucose is in your bloodstream, it needs help — a “key” — to get into its final destination where it’s used, which is inside your body’s cells (cells make up your body’s tissues and organs). This help or “key” is insulin.\n\nInsulin is a hormone made by your pancreas, an organ located behind your stomach. Your pancreas releases insulin into your bloodstream. Insulin acts as the “key” that unlocks the cell wall “door,” which allows glucose to enter your body’s cells. Glucose provides the “fuel” or energy tissues and organs need to properly function.\n\nIf you have diabetes:\n\nYour pancreas doesn’t make any insulin or enough insulin.\n\nOr\n\nYour pancreas makes insulin but your body’s cells don’t respond to it and can’t use it as it normally should.\n\nIf glucose can’t get into your body’s cells, it stays in your bloodstream and your blood glucose level rises.\n\nHave you been looking for 1 Food That Kills Diabete? don’t go far away I’m presenting you the best Smart Blood Sugar, it is not drugs, and it is very cheap check it out and thank me later.\n\nRead more here", "score": 0.755286300592156, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7552862763404846, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3070953162870266, "llm_reward": 0.755286300592156, "utility": 0.48160656698970206, "reward_gap": 0.4481909843051294, "source": "medium"}

One such innovative material is a 3D printed plastic that can self-heal using LED lights. This technology was pioneered by researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).\n\n**University Research Background**\n\nThe researchers at UNSW developed a special powder, which they called a proprietary compound, to create this unique material. This powder is mixed into the resin during the 3D printing process. The self-healing mechanism is activated by LED lights, which initiate a chemical reaction that repairs any cracks or breaks in the material.\n\n**How the Repair Process Works**\n\nThe self-healing process begins when the LED lights are turned on. The light activates the chemical components in the powder, causing a reaction that seals any damage. This process is both rapid and efficient, allowing the material to return to its original strength within minutes.\n\n**Potential Applications**\n\nThe potential applications of this self-healing 3D printed plastic are vast and varied. It can be used in a wide range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, and construction. For example, in the automotive industry, it could be used to repair minor dents and scratches in car bodies, reducing the need for costly repairs.

To turn my heater on and off, I would need two SwitchBots, one for each side of the toggle switch. After reading the product reviews, I was unsure if the SwitchBot would even have enough force to press the toggle switch. Ultimately, I decided against spending $60 on an imperfect solution, and to make something bespoke to my heater.\n\nThe heater’s control panel.

At its core, holistic dentistry emphasizes preventive care, patient education, and the use of natural materials to promote oral health. One of the key connections between oral health and overall wellness is the oral-systemic link, which highlights the impact of oral health on systemic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\n**Oral-Systemic Link:**\nGum disease, for example, has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. The bacteria that cause gum disease can enter the bloodstream and contribute to inflammation in the arteries, leading to plaque buildup and potential heart problems. By maintaining good oral hygiene and seeking treatment for gum disease, individuals can reduce their risk of heart disease.\n\n**Practical Examples:**\nHolistic dentists often use mercury-free fillings, which are gentler on the body and do not release harmful metals into the bloodstream. Natural materials like biocompatible composites and ceramic fillings are also popular choices. Additionally, preventive education is crucial. Holistic dentists educate patients on proper brushing and flossing techniques, the importance of regular check-ups, and the benefits of a healthy diet.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, holistic dentistry not only improves oral health but also supports overall wellness. Whether you are exploring wellness options or seeking a more natural approach to dental care, holistic dentistry can provide a comprehensive and effective solution.\nWould you like to add any specific examples or further details to these sections?\n</response>", "gts": "Holistic dentistry, also referred to as conservative dentistry and biological dentistry is a form of preventive dental care that prioritizes the health and healing of your natural smile.

Instead of using amalgam materials for dental implants, they prefer to use biocompatible” or natural materials as Amalgams contain mercury, which may cause post-placement sensitivity. There is also a risk of bacteria remnants, which may lead to secondary dental surgery.\n\nWhat is Holistic Dentistry?\n\nHolistic dentistry treats oral problems by focusing on all aspects of health including your physical, emotional, and spiritual health. The philosophy behind holistic dentistry is:\n\nNever treat when you can prevent or heal instead\n\nWhen you must treat, provide technical excellence using minimally invasive methods and non-toxic materials\n\nEmploy safeguards to protect against exposure to known toxins, like mercury\n\nUse treatments that stimulate the body’s natural ability to heal\n\nHow Does Holistic Dentistry Support Total-Body Health?\n\nOptimal oral health promotes the health of your entire body. Poor oral health is associated with increased risk for more serious health conditions, including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.\n\nThe holistic dentistry techniques are designed to protect not just your smile, but your whole body! Using top dental tools and technologies to deliver non-toxic, health-based treatments, the dentist can help identify potential dental problems early on.\n\nIf you prefer natural remedies or whole-health treatment for dental care that prioritizes your complete health with safe materials and effective treatments then Holistic dentistry is the right choice for you.", "score": 0.7778398484446184, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7778398394584656, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.3862780484018681, "llm_reward": 0.7778398484446184, "utility": 0.5481445599715389, "reward_gap": 0.3915618000427503, "source": "medium"}

Let’s dive into the basics of diet, activity, and health metrics.\n\n### Interactive Quiz\nThe quiz will guide you through basic questions about your diet, activity, and health metrics. Here’s an example of what the quiz might look like:\n\n1. **Diet**: How often do you consume fruits and vegetables?\n   - A. Rarely\n   - B. Occasionally\n   - C. Regularly\n   - D. Always\n\n2. **Activity**: How many days a week do you exercise?\n   - A. None\n   - B. 1-2 days\n   - C. 3-4 days\n   - D. 5+ days\n\n3. **Health Metrics**: What is your current A1C level?\n   - A. Below 5.7%\n   - B. 5.7% - 6.4%\n   - C. 6.5% - 7.2%\n   - D. Above 7.2%\n\n### Success Stories\nKustomDiabetes has helped many individuals manage their diabetes naturally. For example, Sarah reversed her pre-diabetes by following the quiz’s plant-based meal plan. Here’s how she did it:\n\n1. **Diet**: She increased her intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n2. **Activity**: She started walking for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.\n3. **Health Metrics**: She monitored her A1C levels regularly and adjusted her diet and exercise plan accordingly.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following the quiz’s recommendations and making small, sustainable changes, you can improve your health and manage diabetes naturally. KustomDiabetes is here to support you every step of the way.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments or additional information.\n</response>", "gts": "Do try it once.\n\nNatural cures for diabetes must take into consideration your unique cause. Then it must target your personal symptoms, which will have endless permutations of the major and common symptoms. Only this personal approach can come even close to a cure. Everything else is simply suppressing the cause or dealing with the effect.\n\nA cure must, by definition, be temporary treatment. Providing you with the strength to push through and manage on your own.\n\nBefore looking at what natural modalities can achieve this, there is one area of natural health care than has and is also curing diabetes, in animals as well as people.\n\nDiet.\n\nThe old saying of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ couldn’t be more true for health. Eat processed food or a diet which is essentially nutrient poor, and how can you expect your health to be good? Or, to put it another way, if you put diesel in your unleaded vehicle, would you expect it to run at all, let alone well?\n\nWhy is the area of your local supermarket that sells fresh fruit and vegetables quite a small area in comparison with the rest of the store? Because people don’t buy enough! A recent survey came to the worrying conclusion that about 80% of the food bought in a typical western country was processed.\n\nYet a recent study discovered that when people ate a totally raw diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, not only did their diabetes reduce, IT VANISHED COMPLETELY. After this diet for only one month, all the long term users of insulin no longer needed it.\n\nSo diet is essential to your good health and if you have diabetes, this is an area that you must address first, to get any results.\n\nBut let’s go back to the modality of health care that can cure diabetes discussed earlier.

When blood sugar levels rise, such as after eating, the pancreas releases insulin to help cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood sugar levels. Conversely, when blood sugar levels are low, insulin helps prevent the breakdown of stored glucose into energy.\n\nFor individuals with diabetes, maintaining proper blood sugar control is essential. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to various health complications if not managed effectively. In Kuwait, diabetes is a significant public health issue, affecting a substantial portion of the population. Understanding the role of insulin and when to consult specialists is crucial for managing diabetes.\n\n**Understanding Insulin**\n\nInsulin is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. There are two main types of insulin: exogenous insulin (administered through injections or an insulin pump) and endogenous insulin (produced naturally by the body). Exogenous insulin is often prescribed to individuals with type 1 diabetes, while both types of insulin are used in type 2 diabetes management.\n\n**When to Consult Specialists**\n\nWhile maintaining a healthy lifestyle and following a prescribed treatment plan is essential, it is important to recognize when to seek professional medical advice. If you are a diabetes patient in Kuwait and experience any of the following symptoms, it is advisable to consult a specialist:\n\n- Frequent urination\n- Increased thirst and hunger\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow-healing wounds\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms persisting or worsening, it is crucial to consult a specialist. Specialists in Kuwait, such as endocrinologists, can provide personalized care and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\n**General Advice for Diabetes Patients in Kuwait**\n\n1. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep track of your blood sugar levels regularly, as recommended by your healthcare provider. This will help you understand how your body responds to different factors and adjust your treatment accordingly.\n2. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and manage stress. These lifestyle changes can help improve your overall health and blood sugar control.\n3. **Follow Treatment Plan**: Adhere to your prescribed medication regimen and follow any dietary or exercise recommendations provided by your healthcare provider.\n4. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about diabetes and its management. Knowledge is power, and staying informed can help you make informed decisions about your health.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHuman insulin is a vital hormone in blood sugar control, and understanding its role is crucial for managing diabetes effectively. In Kuwait, diabetes is a significant public health issue, and it is essential to recognize when to consult specialists. By following a healthy lifestyle, monitoring your blood sugar levels, and adhering to your treatment plan, you can manage diabetes and improve your quality of life.\n\n---\n\nI hope this draft meets your expectations. Please review the final version quickly, and let me know if you need any further adjustments.\n</response>", "gts": "Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and has many important functions in the human body, especially in controlling blood sugar levels and preventing high blood sugar. Insulin is a hormone that helps transport sugar from the blood to the cells in the body.\n\nInsulin allows your body to use the sugar (glucose) in carbohydrates for energy or store glucose for future use. The most important function of insulin in the human body is its interaction with glucose, and thereby it enables the cells in the body to use glucose as energy for daily chores.\n\nThe more glucose in the blood, the more insulin the pancreas secretes. For the glucose in the blood to enter the cells, the pancreas produces insulin, which sends signals to the cells in the body to absorb the sugar into the blood. For people without diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin to remove a sugar called glucose from the blood, into the cells, and use it as energy. However, diabetes affects this process, which is why some diabetics need extra insulin.\n\nBut if someone has diabetes, either the body cannot produce insulin, or insulin does not work properly in the body. If you don’t have enough insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of supplying energy to your body. In the absence of insulin, the body cannot use glucose as energy in cells.

Here are some effective strategies to help you achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Olive Oil Routine**: Apply a few drops of olive oil to your hair every night before bed. This nourishes your hair and prevents breakage.\n2. **Food-Based Nutrition**: Ensure you’re getting enough protein, iron, and vitamins from your diet. Foods like spinach, eggs, and almonds are particularly beneficial.\n3. **Gentle Care**: Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair and avoid harsh chemicals. Shampoo and condition gently to keep your hair healthy.\n4. **Avoid Towel-Rubbing**: After washing, gently blot your hair with a clean towel to remove excess water. This prevents friction and breakage.\n\nBy following these steps, you can grow long hair naturally without relying on biotin or supplements. Stay consistent, and your hair will thank you!\n\n---\n\nWould you like to add the 4-minute head-down step from your original idea?

The reason for my action was that I was bored of my sun-damaged, lifeless, damaged, and broken hair, which did not appear to ever come back in the correct state.\n\nSo, to address the situation, I utilized the scissors. My hair was trimmed in a long A-bob side. The style looked great on me, and I felt like a whole new person.\n\nBut the good vibes didn’t last long. After a while, I began to miss my long hair, so I began Googling and clicking on any link on the internet that promised long hair.\n\nThe Best Kept Not-So Secret? Olive Oil!\n\nStay with your head down, for about 4 minutes after applying the olive oil along the length of your hair. The reason for this is that blood will circulate more freely through your head’s epidermis, making it easier for your hair to absorb all of the nutrients.\n\nAfter that, cover the mask with a cloth and let it on for around 30 minutes.

The process begins with the breakdown of barley straw, which releases a substance known as 'humid acid.' This acid is not the same as traditional acids like sulfuric or hydrochloric, but it is a form of organic acid that can be highly effective in breaking down organic matter.\n\nThe 'humid acid' is formed through a series of chemical reactions that occur naturally in the environment. These reactions involve the breakdown of cellulose and lignin, which are components of the barley straw. The acid then reacts with other organic compounds in the water, such as proteins and fats, to form hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent that can help break down algae and other organic matter.\n\nAs the decomposition process continues, the barley straw shifts from a bacterial-dominated environment to one dominated by fungi. This shift is crucial because fungi are more efficient at breaking down complex organic compounds. The fungi produce enzymes that can break down the remaining organic matter, further enhancing the water purification process.\n\nOne of the significant benefits of using barley straw is its positive impact on aquatic plant growth. After algae are suppressed, aquatic plants often grow more robustly. This is because the removal of algae creates a more favorable environment for plants, allowing them to thrive and potentially improve water quality even further.\n\n---\n\nI've included a follow-up question to ensure the clarity of the points:\nWould you like me to add any other specific details or examples to further clarify these points?\n</response>", "gts": "Everyone of us is familiar with the problem of eutrophication , it’s nothing too hard , but yes it is one of the most serious global problem .To start with , eutrophication is the excess growth of algae in water. But algae are not something which is harmful for our planet or for us , it is just natural thing that happens . Algal blooms are part of the ecosystem ,and are pre-present in a water body .\n\nWhenever there’s eutrophication , the marine life in the water body gets adversely affected . As the sun rays are blocked , as well as when these algae die , they are consumed by aerobic bacteria which leads to anoxic conditions in the water body , further leading to creation of dead zones .\n\nSince 1990 , in London , barley straws have been employed to clean ponds having mammoth amounts of algae growing in them .\n\nBarley straws during decomposition, the cellular structure of the barley begins to break down, and the rate of breakdown is dependent on water temperature and oxygen content\n\nAfter a few weeks, decomposition changes from being bacteria dominant to fungi dominant, leading to “rotting”.\n\nAs fungi eat away at the remains of the barley material, humid acid is produced, which is the first major step towards algae control. As the humid acids leech into the surrounding water it reacts with oxygen and sunlight, becoming more and more unstable and eventually forming a superoxide radical which leads to hydrogen peroxide.\n\nHydrogen peroxide is a powerful algaecide, but when produced from correctly dosed barley it’s in a low enough concentration to be safe for fish and still work as an algae deterrent.\n\nBarley straw does not reduce the growth of other aquatic plants. In fact, in some cases aquatic plant growth has increased after barley straw applications because algae are no longer present to compete with the aquatic plants.\n\nTherefore, Barley Straw has proven to be the most sustainable and eco-friendly solution for the treatment of eutrophication .", "score": 0.791332611999845, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7913326025009155, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.25, "user_reward": 0.46267621241435675, "llm_reward": 0.791332611999845, "utility": 0.605087411602694, "reward_gap": 0.3286563995854882, "source": "medium"}

When blood sugar levels rise, such as after eating, the pancreas releases insulin to help cells absorb glucose from the bloodstream, lowering blood sugar levels. Conversely, when blood sugar levels are low, insulin helps prevent the breakdown of stored glucose into energy.\n\nFor individuals with diabetes, maintaining proper blood sugar control is essential. Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can lead to various health complications if not managed effectively. In Kuwait, diabetes is a significant public health issue, affecting a substantial portion of the population. Understanding the role of insulin and when to consult specialists is crucial for managing diabetes.\n\n**Understanding Insulin**\n\nInsulin is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. There are two main types of insulin: exogenous insulin (administered through injections or an insulin pump) and endogenous insulin (produced naturally by the body). Exogenous insulin is often prescribed to individuals with type 1 diabetes, while both types of insulin are used in type 2 diabetes management.\n\n**When to Consult Specialists**\n\nWhile maintaining a healthy lifestyle and following a prescribed treatment plan is essential, it is important to recognize when to seek professional medical advice. If you are a diabetes patient in Kuwait and experience any of the following symptoms, it is advisable to consult a specialist:\n\n- Frequent urination\n- Increased thirst and hunger\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Fatigue\n- Blurred vision\n- Slow-healing wounds\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms persisting or worsening, it is crucial to consult a specialist. Specialists in Kuwait, such as endocrinologists, can provide personalized care and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\n**General Advice for Diabetes Patients in Kuwait**\n\n1. **Regular Monitoring**: Keep track of your blood sugar levels regularly, as recommended by your healthcare provider. This will help you understand how your body responds to different factors and adjust your treatment accordingly.\n2. **Healthy Lifestyle**: Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and manage stress. These lifestyle changes can help improve your overall health and blood sugar control.\n3. **Follow Treatment Plan**: Adhere to your prescribed medication regimen and follow any dietary or exercise recommendations provided by your healthcare provider.\n4. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about diabetes and its management. Knowledge is power, and staying informed can help you make informed decisions about your health.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHuman insulin is a vital hormone in blood sugar control, and understanding its role is crucial for managing diabetes effectively. In Kuwait, diabetes is a significant public health issue, and it is essential to recognize when to consult specialists. By following a healthy lifestyle, monitoring your blood sugar levels, and adhering to your treatment plan, you can manage diabetes and improve your quality of life.\n\n---\n\nI hope this draft meets your expectations.

Insulin is a hormone that helps transport sugar from the blood to the cells in the body.\n\nInsulin allows your body to use the sugar (glucose) in carbohydrates for energy or store glucose for future use. The most important function of insulin in the human body is its interaction with glucose, and thereby it enables the cells in the body to use glucose as energy for daily chores.\n\nThe more glucose in the blood, the more insulin the pancreas secretes. For the glucose in the blood to enter the cells, the pancreas produces insulin, which sends signals to the cells in the body to absorb the sugar into the blood. For people without diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin to remove a sugar called glucose from the blood, into the cells, and use it as energy. However, diabetes affects this process, which is why some diabetics need extra insulin.\n\nBut if someone has diabetes, either the body cannot produce insulin, or insulin does not work properly in the body. If you don’t have enough insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of supplying energy to your body. In the absence of insulin, the body cannot use glucose as energy in cells. This is when you have to consult the diabetes doctors in Kuwait .\n\nThe World Health Organization guidelines recommend human insulin products for patients with type 1 diabetes who need cheap insulin options. Regular Human Insulin is used in conjunction with a proper diet and exercise program to help control high blood sugar levels in diabetic patients. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood and is necessary for the normal functioning of the body.", "score": 0.7013676876317161, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7013676762580872, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.23750000000000002, "user_reward": 0.3140988786563358, "llm_reward": 0.7013676876317161, "utility": 0.4693599942591073, "reward_gap": 0.3872688089753803, "source": "medium"}

If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure.

The target is under 500 words. Should I start with an intro about why buzzwords alone don’t work, then move into actionable steps like self-reflection exercises? Also, do you think including a section addressing 'I don’t have good experiences' would help readers? What structure would you recommend?Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet).

An answer with a targeted follow-up (AQ) could add value but is less efficient. The LLM's correctness risk is low, and the user's ambiguity is minimal.
