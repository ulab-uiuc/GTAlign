It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure.

It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors.

Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Who is won the most majors in golf?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is clear and specific (DQ).\n- DA (direct answer) risks being incomplete and not providing the most accurate information.\n- CQ (clarifying question) might lead to more ambiguity and could be seen as unhelpful.\n- AQ (answer + follow-up) provides context and encourages the user to provide more information, potentially leading to a more accurate answer.\n</thinking>\n<payoff>\n{\n  \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.5},\n  \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 1.8, \"user\": 1.4},\n  \"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.5, \"user\": 2.0},\n  \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 1.9, \"user\": 1.3},\n  \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 1.5, \"user\": 1.2},\n  \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.7}\n}\n</payoff>\n<analyze>\n- DA and CQ are both low in both metrics, but DA is slightly better for the user.\n- AQ is the best for both metrics, providing context and encouraging more accurate information.\n- The Pareto frontier shows that AQ is the best overall, balancing both metrics well.\n- AQ is chosen as it provides the most accurate and helpful answer.\n</analyze>\n<response>\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The golfer who has won the most major championships is Jack Nicklaus with 18 victories.
