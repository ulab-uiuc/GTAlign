Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous.

Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Where are the cadillacs buried in the ground?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is vague and ambiguous (VQ).\n- DA (direct answer)

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nNow you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet).

It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nNow you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Name the two forms of polymorphism in cnidarian?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is clear and specific (DQ).\n- DA (direct

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nNow you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)).

It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure.

Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}.

Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0].

Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences).

Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Who is won the most majors in golf?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>\n- User's question is clear and specific (DQ).\n- DA (direct answer) risks ambiguity and might be seen as incomplete.\n- CQ (clarifying question only) could lead to more ambiguity.\n- AQ (answer + follow-up) provides context and can lead to a more satisfying and informative response.\n</thinking>\n<payoff>\n{\n  \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.5},\n  \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 1.8, \"user\": 1.4},\n  \"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.1, \"user\": 1.6},\n  \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.5},\n  \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2},\n  \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8}\n}\n</payoff>\n<analyze>\n- DA and CQ are less satisfactory for the user.\n- AQ provides a more comprehensive answer and follow-up, balancing LLM and user satisfaction.\n- The Pareto frontier shows that AQ is the best option, offering a good balance of satisfaction and information.\n</analyze>\n<response>\n{\n  \"answer\": \"The player who has won the most major championships in golf is Jack Nicklaus with 18 victories.\",\n  \"follow_up\": \"Is there a specific major championship you're interested in or a particular player you'd like more information about?\"\n}\n</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###Jack Nicklaus", "score": 0.7253723021098222, "step": 35, "reward": 0.725372314453125, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.225, "user_reward": 0.6523866066086127, "llm_reward": 0.7983579976110318, "utility": 0.7216911146192032, "reward_gap": 0.14597139100241907, "source": "ambig_qa"}
