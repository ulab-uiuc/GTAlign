Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) are expected to continue their momentum, offering new opportunities for capital protection and fundamental analysis. The metaverse, while still in its early stages, could revolutionize the way we interact with digital assets. NFTs are also expected to gain traction, with more use cases emerging beyond just art and collectibles.\n\nFor investors, it's crucial to focus on capital protection and fundamental analysis. Web3 projects that prioritize security and scalability are likely to be more resilient. DeFi platforms that offer transparent and secure protocols are also worth considering. NFTs, while speculative, can be a good hedge against inflation and provide unique investment opportunities.\n\nAs always, it's important to diversify your portfolio and stay informed about the latest developments. Remember to keep an eye on regulatory changes and the overall market sentiment.\n\nWhat specific web3, DeFi, or NFT projects do you think will be the most promising in 2022, and why?\"\n\nFeel free to add any additional points or adjust the tone as needed. Let me know if you need more details or have any specific questions!\n</response>", "gts": "There is this expectation in the crypto space next year. There has been a lot things happening in this space this year. Talking about NFT, web3, metaverse, defi adoption, gamefi, and the rest. Well, some concepts have been there while others resurface this year. However, the big expectation for next year happens to be web3, defi-2, metaverse, gamefi, and L2. Worthy of note is that, these sectors still have a lot of improvement to do. Talking about metaverse, nobody actually knows the true shape of it. Different companies have different speculations and approaches to building it. Truth be told, metaverse, web3, and defi-2 all have their own drawbacks. Some companies championing these sectors might not be there in the next 5–10 years. Companies that will come up in the future will leverage on the mistakes of those in the past to build. That is why, as an investor, your most important assignment is the protection of your capital. You must make your own research so you don’t put your money in a project that won’t succeed.\n\nHowever, there is also a great potential in these projects, especially, now that they are still very young. Common rule of investment in this space is to go where the money is. You only have one thing to do, and that is to follow the smart money. Don’t go against the tide, else, you will be consumed. That’s why you must not joke with fundamental analysis. This analysis shows you where the money is going to and you are just to follow.\n\nFinally, always remember that this space is still very much new. Like a wise man would say, don’t commit your money in a craft that you don’t understand. Make sure you learn and always keep learning.

The growth of the market is attributed to the increasing demand for topical analgesics.\n\nAnalgesics are the counter pain drugs which support in regulating a pain until and unless it is completely eliminated. OTC analgesic drugs are used by people without any need of prescription. Analgesics which do not require doctor’s prescription are classified as OTC analgesics. OTC analgesics are available in brand and generic preparations as tablets, capsules, creams, sprays, and patches. These OTC analgesics constitute three active ingredients namely paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin.\n\nParacetamol is a most commonly used OTC analgesic. Its analgesic property is similar to that of aspirin and ibuprofen. It does not carry any anti-inflammatory effects. Paracetamol prevents prostaglandin synthesis within the central nervous system. It is the first choice of analgesic for pain management. Common side-effects associated with paracetamol are hypersensitivity, rare cases of blood dyscrasias (including thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis). Aspirin is another common OTC analgesic. It is analgesic, antipyretic, antiplatelet, and anti-inflammatory. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase results in analgesic effect of aspirin. Incompatible effects of aspirin are epigastric pain, gastrointestinal ulceration, nausea and vomiting, hypersensitivity, and gout.\n\nMarket Drivers\n\nIncreasing demand of topical analgesics, which are available as pain-relieving creams, lotions, rubs, gels, and sprays, has increased the sales of analgesics by 18 percent. According to Kline Non-prescription Drugs US report, increasing geriatric population worldwide, will generate the demand for pain relief products. According to the US Census Bureau, between 2012 and 2050, the United States will experience considerable growth in its older population. Thus, the growth in geriatric population is driving the growth of the global OTC analgesics market.\n\nAdditionally, the cost efficiency of OTC analgesics drugs is also responsible for fuelling the growth of the market.\n\nVisit https://insights10.com/ for more healthcare industry insights.", "score": 0.17741879306683905, "step": 5, "reward": 0.1774187982082367, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.0, "user_reward": 0.17741879306683905, "llm_reward": 0.23234744056571477, "utility": 0.20303399340341566, "reward_gap": 0.054928647498875716, "source": "medium"}

Vijay Balasubramanian Dec 13, 2021·2 min read\n\nI am sure every blogging and social media platform on the web has spoken about this. So it is about time, the actual folks noticed what is going wrong with your Apps.\n\nPhoto by Viktor Avdeev on Unsplash\n\nOLA and Uber taxi drivers in India are taking orders, then speaking to clients and then cancelling rides. Once the rides are cancelled, they are dropping clients at their respective destinations and taking money offline. Why you wonder?\n\nThe simple answer is high commissions from Ola and Uber. Previously it was bad drivers looking to make high numbers with each ride. Right now its only Ola/Uber who’s fueling this problem.\n\nI’ve heard it from all drivers I took in the last 3 months. Most of them requested I cancel and pay them directly. While I refused one, I couldn’t refuse the 2 more due to urgency. But its a telling sign of things if all drivers can feel the pinch.\n\nFunnily enough Ola even has an option to report this saying ‘Driver asked me to cancel the ride and pay offline’. Which shows that Ola is more than aware of this issue. I am not willing to believe that they don’t know why this happens.\n\nDrivers are not angels, I get that. But they do not have to constantly do this if Ola charges them reasonably. A lot of drivers are decent folks looking to make a living. So the ball is right now in OLA/Uber ‘s court. They can solve this permanently if they take reasonable commissions or offer other perks or transfer some of these costs to their customer as subscription fees or something. If they take care of drivers and drivers wont take shortcuts like these.\n\nTill then these ride sharing services are fighting a losing battle. Drivers will constantly find way to circumvent their tech. The app is literally built for the driver, so monitoring the driver’s every action would be next to impossible. Customers can only help them report mishaps to some degree.

So, in a nutshell, it refers to a variety of IT-related services such as storage, networking, database, and software that are virtually given to businesses and organizations through the internet by various cloud hosting providers. This allows organizations to manage their work from anywhere and at any time without having to invest a lot of money on IT infrastructure such as server and network settings.\n\nCloud Hosting Comes in a Variety of Forms\n\nThe way public and private enterprises interact with IT services has changed dramatically as a result of cloud hosting technologies. These businesses only have to pay for the cloud services they utilize, which helps them save money and better manage their infrastructure. Today, we have a variety of cloud computing services to meet practically any IT need. Among these, these are the most important services.\n\nManage your business with unlimited cloud hosting\n\nJachOOs is a renowned cloud hosting service with strong ties to well-known datacenters throughout the world. At low pricing, we provide limitless cloud hosting plans on very capable servers from Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, AWS, DigitalOcean, and Linode. If you’re still using traditional web hosting to operate your business, it’s time to upgrade to limitless cloud hosting with sophisticated features like cPanel, Softaculous, DDoS Protection, SSL Certificates, and more.\n\nJachOOs is one of the best website hosting services in the UAE, based on Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud Hosting, and Microsoft Azure’s main cloud infrastructure providers. You can fully utilize these cloud services’ powerful cloud server since they have invested billions of dollars in their networks and technologies.

Pizza but made by a robot\n\nPazzi is an autonomous pizzeria in Paris with another location in Serris in the East of Paris. They call themselves the world’s first autonomous restaurant. Customers order on a self order terminal which allows them to customise the exact toppings of the pizza. The robot arms then prepare the dough, add the sauce and toppings, put the pizza in the oven and cut it in front of your eyes. If you also ordered a drink you’ll get that from a vending machine. Opinion: Pazzi is an excitable example of how a human task can be automated. There is a large team behind it, so we expect to see more of these restaurants in the near future.\n\nA not even that simple task is automated by a robot arm, fun to watch Pazzi make Pizza!\n\nNews 2.Click & Collect but cool\n\nDelipop launched a pick up location for groceries in cooperation with Carrefour in October. To use its service, customers have to order groceries in Carrefour Drive and set the Delipop store as the pick up location. Customers can pick up their orders the same day if ordered in the morning or next day if ordered later during the day. Customers get an access code to enter the colourful Delipop pick-up store. Opinion: Delipop aggregates orders and thus operates at significant lower cost compared to ultra-fast deliveries. At the same time the fresh and modern designed pick-up stores can keep up with the coolness-factor of Gorillas.\n\nA hip and cool pick-up store for groceries, we hope to see more of these around Europe’s neighbourhoods.\n\nNews 3. “Almost Just Walk Out” but more practical\n\nCarrefour launched their new, first of its kind, autonomous store “Carrefour Flash 10/10” in Paris at the end of November. Utilising cameras and scales the store tracks the products taken and customers just have to pay — no scanning needed. Opinion: Compared to “Just Walk Out” technology, customers still have to pay manually. However they don’t need to download an app and register before before shopping.

The scores for customized collections will be calculated on a per case basis, following the same pattern.\n\nCard score overview\n\nFor example, if you own a Rare card with serial number 7, your card score is 102. This number then will be multiplied by the price category coefficient that is 0.7–1.4 for the sales prices we have had so far.\n\nThere will be ongoing perks and benefits for higher ranking Collectors.

Unlike working from home, which can involve significant expenses for furniture and maintenance, coworking spaces provide a fully equipped environment that is often more cost-effective. Additionally, the shared space can enhance your professional image, making it easier to meet and impress clients and partners. We encourage you to join us and experience the benefits firsthand!\\n\\nWould you like me to add a brief call to action at the end of the article to encourage readers to join us?\",\n  \"followup\": \"Do you think it would be helpful to include a call to action at the end of the article to encourage readers to join us in a coworking space?\"\n}\n</response>", "gts": "More and more entrepreneurs and remote workers are choosing to join coworking spaces. Beginning your business from home is a cost-effective option, but it can lack the professionalism and growth your business may eventually require.\n\nThere are numerous benefits to joining a coworking community:\n\nBe Part of a Community\n\nWork with like-minded individuals who will encourage you to grow. Even if you work from home, it’s a great way to connect to business owners, leaders, freelancers, start-ups, and entrepreneurs. Find networking opportunities and inspiration from relationships you will build.\n\nWorking alone doesn’t mean you have to be lonely!\n\nFlexibility & Convenience\n\nWork and set your own schedule with a variety of options to fit your needs. Need a conference room once a month? Book it! Need more desks for added team members? Expand to a bigger office space! Are you a parent who needs a quiet space away from kids? Coworking can give you the break you need to get work done!\n\nYou can easily book space for a day or a month at a time. Coworking is a hybrid work model which allows you the flexibility you need to run your business.\n\nInvaluable Tools & Resources\n\nCoworking allows you the opportunity to grow by providing resources you may not otherwise have available to you including:\n\nCost Savings\n\nCoworking will save you money by minimizing your overhead costs. You will only pay for the space you need, not the managed facilities. This can be a huge savings for your business compared to renting a leased office.\n\nWhen using a coworking office, you don’t have to worry about chairs, desks, maintenance costs, or decorating the space. You won’t need to purchase furniture. Outfitting a new office can be very expensive as well as take time and effort.\n\nProfessional Workspace\n\nMake a good impression when meeting with potential clients, interviewing, training, hosting webinars, events, and more.

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: This looks like a solid start. Could you clarify the structure a bit more? For example, should we lead with the beta launch announcement first, or start by explaining the importance of smart contract audits in blockchain projects? Also, are we sure the U1 token details and business asset NFT plans are clearly highlighted?Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question.

The objective of beta testing is to identify security risks by testing the functionality of the smart contract. This will help evaluate the quality of the coding and its efficiency.\n\nSmart contract audits are the first line of defence to safeguard investors’ funds. Quillhash, a leading blockchain code auditing firm, has checked the smart contract code for Unicus.\n\nLaunching a product in beta is knowingly releasing it with possible bugs to users. This enables an enterprise to observe how a product is performing when stretched. A beta launch has been a great way to identify the bugs and thereafter work to resolve them. A sub-par performance of a code during the beta phase helps smooth out the friction before the final version is released.\n\nIn blockchain-based products, beta launch generally comes after a smart contract audit that helps companies avoid potentially catastrophic vulnerabilities. An audit comprises automatic scans as well as expert reviews. Automatic scans via APIs and manual checking of code gives users peace of mind as they know the code is fortified.\n\nUnicus is a one-of-a-kind marketplace for NFTs, resolving the existing pain-points in the ecosystem such as unauthorized NFTs, lack of value transfer across blockchain, and absence of loans against NFTs among others. On Unicus, traders find a cross-chain marketplace that is simple to work on and secure.\n\nAs a one-stop platform facilitating a full range of trading activities, Unicus enables traders play NFTs at their full potential. It has effectively plugged the gaps in the existing NFT marketplace ecosystem. The platform also offers advanced statistical and historical capabilities.\n\nUnicus enables content creators to mint NFTs, add metadata and necessary code to the tokens to attain objectives such as continual payment of royalty to the original creator. Adding metadata is as simple as filling a form.\n\nNative token of the marketplace is U1 with the total supply of 250 million tokens. It is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain followed by Polygon (Matic).\n\nBy June 2022, Unicus plans to launch NFTs for business assets as well.", "score": 0.1717620475979389, "step": 5, "reward": 0.17176204919815063, "answer_reward": 3.276904131432471e-41, "format_reward": 0.08749999999999998, "user_reward": 0.1717620475979389, "llm_reward": 0.15677189695093685, "utility": 0.16409589277646772, "reward_gap": 0.014990150647002043, "source": "medium"}

Although kicked off by the advent of the celebrity entrepreneur, it wasn’t soon until the average citizen made the decision that working for a living was, indeed, their actual lifestyle.\n\nElon Musk, the founder of Tesla, famously tweeted that “nobody ever changed the world in 40 hours a week”, suggesting that people would need to work twice as hard in order to reach the upper echelons of success.\n\nThis new breed of entrepreneurs has seemingly enhanced the work ethic usually associated with the gig worker. The thing that separates ‘hustle culture’ from ordinary hard work and long hours can be summed up in one word: passion. Entrepreneurs, gig workers, small business owners, and others make their living by doing what they love every day. This is what keeps people motivated to work in the wee hours of the night or to sacrifice their weekends or other off days. Owning your own business comes with certain responsibilities that may seem like more work to some, but won’t feel the same if you’re the owner.\n\nSmall business owners know that their jobs don’t end once the clock hits 5 o’clock. If you aren’t running business operations into the evenings, you’re thinking about new ways to improve your sales, talking to potential customers and vendors, or looking for ways to cut costs and increase revenue. Regardless of your situation as a business owner, one way to help establish a healthy work ethic is to keep your finances organized and in check. Here is where financial management services can help you achieve your success story.\n\nEspecially for the gig worker, dealing with multiple sources of income is the norm. The same is true about accounts payable, as there is a strong possibility of having various vendors that need to be paid for their services as well. Hustle culture might find you dealing with many vendors and clients over time, so having a centralized platform for financial management can help save time and stress. Services like Chime.com, Bill.com or Metaprise — Commerce Bank, to name a few, can help to handle your business finances and, conversely, take some of the stress off your role as an Owner. It’s worth checking out one of these time-saving services and thus provide yourself time to put a little life back into your hustle.", "score": 0.10860198246139768, "step": 5, "reward": 0.10860197991132736, "answer_reward": 1.1477514436127405e-82, "format_reward": 0.1, "user_reward": 0.10860198246139768, "llm_reward": 0.25873044824117314, "utility": 0.16762648836659869, "reward_gap": 0.15012846577977546, "source": "medium"}

For my entry on December 15th, I’m focusing on a team that has been on a bit of a roll, but is now looking to turn luck around. Let’s dive into the numbers and stats to see how this team stacks up.\n\n**Elon University**\nElon University has been a standout team this season, boasting a Kenpom defensive efficiency (FG%) of under 300. This is a testament to their defense, which has been a key factor in their success. With a defense that is stingy, Elon is a formidable opponent for any team looking to score points.\n\n**Omaha**\nOmaha, on the other hand, has been a team to watch this season. They are averaging over 80 points per game, which is a significant number in college basketball. This offensive firepower, combined with a defense that is not as strong as Elon’s, makes Omaha a challenging matchup.\n\n**100% Deposit Match Offer**\nDon’t forget about the 100% deposit match offer from PrizePicks. This is a great incentive to get involved and make your picks.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust any details as needed.

He is a force to be reckoned with down low and is shooting over 60% from the field and 70% from the free throw line this year. Although he’s gone over this total in just 4 of 10 games, the fact he’s scored 14+ in 7 games and less than 12 just once this year, almost guarantees he’ll at least threaten this number. He and Winthrop get an Elon team which has a sub 300 Kenpom defensive ranking and allows over 77 points/gm.

The parts that come out of your belly, Visceral fat, actually act as a hormonal gland. They exude a lot of enzymes, cytokines, and proteins, which actually originate from insulin deficiency.\n\nThey are actually protecting themselves, especially in that area, where you do everything you can, but that requires belly fat. You develop that fatty. Well, you will go. But I will tell you, this solid is very difficult to remove because it protects itself from a lot of cytokines.\n\nSo the best way to avoid this problem or the best way to prevent it is to not gain belly overweight. We’Ll be talking about that in a second, But I’ll tell you about my belly. Fat is a hormonal gland that protects itself.\n\nWell, we all adored desserts and alcohol right, So social gatherings, you are familiar with, parties, you are familiar with birthdays And on daylights of every kind of anniversaries, we are always subject.\n\nYou know, making this difficult decision is the decision to eat and not to eat, to booze and not to suck. It’s a tough decision all around us. So every time you say, oh it’s for once it won’t hurt me it’ll hurt yourself, And that bit of booze and any sweeteners any carbs becomes straight to your belly. Your belly fat will accept that gently and won’t let it go.\n\nlow-spirited estrogen positions lead to belly: overweight So it’s no wonder my department is full of women trying to menopause to understand why they are gaining load, even though they haven’t changed anything in “people’s lives”, and I don’t denounce them because when estrogen heights lower, regrettably, your mas switches the force out of your buttocks And?

Drilling and production facilities mainly utilizes these chemicals to improve productivity and efficiency of the process & petroleum refining as well as to attain optimum performance with effective oil recovery. Oilfield chemicals promotes the maintenance of smooth operating oilfield, resulting in reduction of expenses over setbacks and stoppage faced during drilling processes. Additionally, they obstruct the formation of the metal scales and diminish the water level into the oil well during exploration & drilling, which positively affects in increasing demand and applications of oilfield chemicals.\n\nThe global oilfield chemicals market is growing exponentially and predicted to experience rapid growth during the forecast period 2019–2026. The factors majorly driving the growth of oilfield chemicals at global scale include growing exploration and drilling practices for natural resources such as oil and gas, rise in crude oil production, and need to reduce the gap between supply and demand chain. According to OECD, the crude oil production across the world is 3.97 million during the financial year 2017.\n\nFurthermore, increasing population has amplified the energy requirements and to cope with energy demands more oil & gas E&P activities have been under taken to suffice the residential as well as industrial energy demand. This aspect has been boosting the growth of oilfield chemicals market.\n\nAdditionally, shift in inclination towards exploring the unconventional hydrocarbon sources is likely to infiltrate the market growth.

DareNFT has developed a suite of products to address some of the challenges in the NFT landscape, including unrecognized benefits between NFTs, unrecognized relationships between NFT owners and hidden risks of NFT ownership. There are many content types out there and whereas the content types matter at application level, the licensing protocol layer is the same for all of them. Therefore, there is only one protocol needed to serve all.\n\nThe existing licencing processes of derivative content are mostly manual and time consuming. With an NFT 2.0 smart contract, these processes can be automated. Derivative content such as: song remixes, subtitled videos, edited images, learning contents, translated book often generates revenue from the rental and subscription business model. Creators can receive royalties from reproducer’s revenue via the NFT smart contract. This speeds up collaboration and sharing of benefits between the author and re-publisher, resulting in more income for both parties.\n\nThe advent of the NFT 2.0 protocol that DareNFT proposes can mark a new milestone for nonfungible tokens and the crypto market in general. The platform’s competitive advantage is its ability to adapt to emerging trends, banking on its NFT 2.0 protocol which is an essential element for building a thriving platform.\n\nDareNFT will provide InPoker with the access to its ecosystem and the NFT marketplace where InPoker plans to list some of the Elite NFT membership cards. This long-term partnership marks a significant milestone in InPoker’s efforts to introduce the cutting edge technologies to online gaming.\n\nVisit DareNFT: https://darenft.com/\n\nStay tuned for more exciting developments on https://www.inpoker.io\n\nJoin our official Telegram Channel here: https://t.me/influencerpoker", "score": 0.23830890219153575, "step": 5, "reward": 0.23830890655517578, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.23830890219153575, "llm_reward": 0.38012507112486826, "utility": 0.30097705626051763, "reward_gap": 0.14181616893333251, "source": "medium"}

Health encompasses a broad range of physical, mental, and social well-being, while fitness is more focused on physical activity and the maintenance of a healthy body. While both are crucial for a fulfilling life, they serve different purposes and should not be conflated.\n\nTo understand the distinction, let's consider a metaphor. Imagine a tree. The trunk and branches represent the physical structure and overall health of the tree. These elements are essential for the tree to grow and thrive, but they are not the entire picture. The leaves, flowers, and fruits are the fruits of the tree's labor, representing the benefits and outcomes of its health and fitness. Without the health of the tree, the leaves, flowers, and fruits would not be possible.\n\nHealth, in this context, is like the health of the tree. It includes factors such as a strong immune system, good mental health, and a balanced lifestyle. These elements are foundational and necessary for a healthy and fulfilling life. Fitness, on the other hand, is more like the leaves, flowers, and fruits of the tree. It involves regular physical activity, proper nutrition, and a healthy body, which contribute to the overall well-being and quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while health and fitness are interconnected and mutually beneficial, they are not the same. Health is the foundation upon which fitness is built, and fitness is the result of a healthy lifestyle. Both are essential for a balanced and fulfilling life, but they should be pursued separately and in harmony. Let us strive to maintain our health and engage in fitness activities that enhance our well-being, rather than viewing them as interchangeable concepts.\n</response>", "gts": "What is the meaning of fitness? Well, that depends on who you ask. The word fitness can be spread thin when it comes to defining what it is. Fitness can have a different meaning for different groups because it is activity-specific.\n\nPhysical fitness for a powerlifter is not the same kind of fitness for a triathlete. In general, physical fitness is being able to apply the required strength and energy to complete specific physical activities. If a powerlifter cannot complete a triathlon, then he would not be considered fit among a group of competing triathletes.\n\nHealth is different from fitness, but like fitness, there are variations of health. In general, health is being free from illness and sustaining overall wellness. Within this concept, the dimensions of health are physical, mental, and social. Having a healthy body that is not affected by disease or physical impairments is a general description of physical health.\n\nGood mental health is more than just the absence of mental illness. It means you are in a state of well-being where you feel good and function well in the world. Some keys to being in a state of good mental health are:\n\nthe ability to learn\n\nthe ability to feel, express, and manage a range of positive and negative emotions\n\nthe ability to form and maintain good relationships with others\n\nthe ability to cope with and manage change and uncertainty.\n\nThe ability to develop and maintain quality friendships, stay true to yourself while adapting to social situations, and engage with others in your community (work, clubs, religious settings, etc.) are all signs of good social health.\n\nHealth and fitness are often conflated because neither can be attained without proper nutrition. Yes, your mental health is impacted by a poor diet. Nutritional information is a description of how you are either contributing to health and fitness, which are dimensions of wellness or feeding into sickness and disease.\n\nLearn tips for staying well and losing weight during this pandemic:", "score": 0.10400128510346549, "step": 5, "reward": 0.10400128364562988, "answer_reward": 7.33834889254708e-82, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.10400128510346549, "llm_reward": 0.253863079826698, "utility": 0.16248718885592253, "reward_gap": 0.1498617947232325, "source": "medium"}

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Can you help me draft a short article (under 500 words) about Silvermine Gifts’ napkin rings? I want to highlight their handmade products and unique customization options.Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Silvermine Gifts has been family-owned for generations—though I don’t have the exact years, the description mentions it’s ‘family-operated’ with in-house craftsmanship. For engravings, customers often add names, initials, or special dates like anniversaries. Maybe highlight how engraving makes the rings personal for gifts.

As it had been over five years since I had taken a Spanish course I guess I really shouldn’t have been surprised right? Who can really expect to remember much from a high school course that was mediocre at best? As I tried desperately to order a simple sandwich and something to drink, I realized that if I didn’t at least attempt to learn Spanish I would most likely starve after a week or so.\n\nHow exactly does one go about learning Spanish in a Latin American country? Seems pretty easy right? Well, I assure you it is not, especially when your entire day is spent speaking English. Another obstacle that I quickly encountered was the very rapid way in which everyone speaks in this city. It is amazing how a sentence containing 10 words or so can come out sounding almost like one long word. Is that what English sounds like to people who don’t speak English? It is exceedingly difficult to learn words in another language when you are unable to decipher exactly where one word ends and another begins. This process is made even harder by the fact that most people here fail to pronounce the whole word anyway. There were many words that I was convinced I knew and was using quite frequently. Imagine my dismay when I found out they had whole other syllables on the end of the word. No wonder I had been getting funny looks from people on the street and in restaurants.\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that an actual course was needed or even better, a private tutor of some sort. The only way I was ever going to learn Spanish was by actually sitting down and studying with someone who could answer the myriad of questions that arose every day. Sad isn’t it? Here I sit, living in a Latin American country and I am unable to pick up the language without resorting to private lessons. Some people seem to have an ear for languages and can pick them up simply by listening, too bad I will never be one of those people.\n\nACCESS SPANISH LANGUAGE COURSES RIGHT NOW", "score": 0.13459237703425056, "step": 5, "reward": 0.13459238409996033, "answer_reward": 2.021672731871511e-177, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.13459237703425056, "llm_reward": 0.16771215069768358, "utility": 0.15024239421657148, "reward_gap": 0.03311977366343302, "source": "medium"}
{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure.

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Can you help me write a short article (under 500 words) summarizing that study on how Prosecco producers adopted the Rive sub-appellation? I need it to focus on the main factors influencing their decision and the market impact. Also, mention the UNESCO recognition part if possible.Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: The study doesn’t go into specific UNESCO-linked initiatives, just mentions the recognition generally supports wine tourism.

Evidence from an exploratory study on heroic Prosecco Superiore Rive\n\nLuigino Barisan, Research Center for the Viticulture and Enology (CIRVE)\n\nLuigi Galletto, University of Padua, Research Center for the Viticulture and Enology (CIRVE)\n\nThis paper investigates why wineries producing Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Protected Denomination of Origin (CVPP) wines decided to adopt the sub-appellation (SA) “Rive” as a way to increase the value of their wines.\n\nWe estimated both a logistic and a linear regression to explain Rive SA firms’ choices and market growth drivers, respectively. By using data gathered from CVPP producers, we divided wineries into two groups, those that have adopted the Rive SA and those that have not. By means of a stepwise procedure, we categorized factors that were likely to explain the Rive SA choice within a set of structural, marketing and wine tourism-related variables.\n\nThe results showed that structural drivers such as the human capital of younger producers, pressure tank sizes, competitive positioning in the market and in the field of wine tourism hospitality, and involvement in ad hoc promotional activities (i.e., Primavera del Prosecco) have the greatest effects on the choice of the Rive SA. The synergistic effects of cellar door sales, small firm sizes and specific foreign markets (i.e., the United Kingdom and the United States) have emerged, on the other hand, as vital factors in the growth of the Rive SA in terms of market share.\n\nThe adoption of the Rive SA may play an important role in supporting and valuing the heroic viticulture-based economy and may help the CVPP Tutelary Consortium to appropriately undertake promotional strategies to differentiate wines and improve competitiveness. This could have positive effects on wine tourism, hospitality and winery visits in light of the recent recognition of the CVPP as the 55th Italian UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.36253/wep-9900\n\nRead Full Text: https://oaj.fupress.net/index.php/wep/article/view/9900", "score": 0.10887596150646826, "step": 5, "reward": 0.10887596011161804, "answer_reward": 0.0002653507268963378, "format_reward": 0.175, "user_reward": 0.10887596150646826, "llm_reward": 0.3473243230275919, "utility": 0.19446148622339654, "reward_gap": 0.23844836152112364, "source": "medium"}

The rule was introduced in 1992 during the World Cup, where a team was able to score 22 runs in just one ball, leading to a controversial decision. This incident highlighted the rule's limitations and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nIn the 2003 World Cup, South Africa faced Sri Lanka in a crucial match. The D/L rule was applied, and a dropped single by Mark Boucher was a pivotal moment. This dropped single led to a significant change in the match's dynamics, as the D/L rule dictated that Sri Lanka would be awarded more runs, potentially altering the outcome of the match.\n\nThe D/L rule is designed to ensure that the match continues in a fair and consistent manner, but its application can be complex and sometimes lead to unexpected results. Hariprasath argues that the rule should be simplified to better reflect the actual conditions of the game, ensuring that the match's outcome is more closely tied to the teams' performances rather than the arbitrary application of the rule.\n\nWould you like more details on the specific conditions that led to the dropped single and how it affected the match?\n</response>", "gts": "By Hariprasath\n\nMany matches have been turned on its head by the Duckworth Lewis method especially the South African side were always on the wrong side of the result. Even the cricket pundits had difficulty in grasping this rule. The complexity of this rule has led to many controversies, and the difficulty involved in calculating the appropriate score in the rain-affected matches has led to many chaotic situations.\n\nThe controversy regarding this rule was raised at the infamous semifinal in the 1992 world cup. South Africa's side was on the verge of victory before the rain interrupted. South Africa needed 22 of 13 to win before rain interrupted. Ten minutes later, the South African side was informed that they need to score 22 of 1 ball, and this incident raised all sorts of heated discussion on the Duckworth Lewis rule.\n\nIn the version of D/L most commonly in use in international and first-class matches (the ‘Professional Edition’), the target for Team 2 is adjusted simply in proportion to the two teams’ resources, i.e.,\n\nFor example, if a rain delay means that Team 2 only has 70% of resources available, and Team 1 scored 220 with 100% of resources available, then 220 × 70% / 100% = 154, so Team 2’s target is 154, and the score to tie is 153. The actual resource values used in the Professional Edition are not publicly available, so a computer that has this software loaded must be used.\n\nThe other instance where South Africa ended up on the wrong side of the result was at the 2003 world cup.

This can happen due to various reasons such as missing transactions, errors, or incomplete data entry. These accounts are used to provide a partial picture of financial transactions, which can be useful for preliminary analysis or when full records are not available.\n\nIn contrast, the double-entry system is a more comprehensive method where every financial transaction is recorded in two accounts: one as a debit and the other as a credit. This ensures that the total debits equal the total credits, maintaining the balance in the accounting system. The double-entry system is more accurate and reliable but requires more detailed records.\n\nI hope this explanation helps.

It is also not a ‘shortcut’ method as an alternate to the double-entry bookkeeping system.

Either by yourself or through software.\n\nUse reels and IGTV the most.\n\nFor a new account starting in 2022, here are the things you can follow;\n\nLearn what type of videos is trending already in your niche.\n\nTo do this:\n\nAnalyze some top influencers and their content.\n\nUse Viralspy for checking out your competitor’s post and account. You’ll get the engagement rates and top hashtags they use.\n\nYou can use this to figure out what content to create to grow faster.\n\nKeep in mind that the content that you create must be similar to them. Apart from niche, how you create content also matters.\n\nIf you will create dancing videos like influencers, check influencers’ accounts on Viralspy.\n\nIf you will create videos through video apps, check out accounts that are creating content like that.\n\nBecause hashtag ranks video content that is similar to each other, you need to create similar videos to get a higher reach. That’s how you can hop on trends.\n\nNow, once you know what video content is working out best for you, focus on Carousels and single slide posts to get the mix of content.\n\nCarousels are a great way to share valuable content. If you’re in the educational field, carousels will help you convert the new people who come across your account into followers.\n\nHere again, try to make the best design along with sharing valuable content.\n\nTry to maintain a brand identity for the long term.", "score": 0.24285298247061043, "step": 5, "reward": 0.24285298585891724, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.24285298247061043, "llm_reward": 0.5725200889223095, "utility": 0.3728782792267766, "reward_gap": 0.3296671064516991, "source": "medium"}
{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: The article looks good but has some repeated sections. Can you revise it to remove duplicate sentences and make the benefits of S3 Care clearer? Also, ensure it stays under 500 words.Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Thanks for the revision!

If there isn’t enough demand, then catering to supply doesn’t make any sense.\n\nIf there is only one diner in a locality, then it is likely to do well. If there are too many diners and not many people to fill up all those places, then most of those enterprises will run out of business.\n\nLikewise, a digital enterprise or any online niche must have enough demand for there to be space to exist. While firms or endeavours can always coexist, the pie gets smaller and there is just less in it for everyone. The hard reality is that if there are enough players in a niche already and some of them have already amassed a massive market share, then penetrating their share or usurping a chunk of it will be a herculean task.\n\nStudy your competition to find out how large a market is and if some of your competitors are already catering to the needs of the audience. If you intend to do the same thing in the same niche, then there is little or no possibility for your enterprise to find a foothold, let aside being a roaring success.\n\nStep 2: Niche within a Niche!\n\nIt is unlikely that the niche you have planned to target will be completely void of competition. There may be stiff or less competition. If there are players already with humongous market shares and dedicated customers or audiences, then you need to find a niche within a niche. You cannot cater to the same exact niche that your competition is committed to.\n\nFor instance, if you are planning to target the niche of food, cuisine or anything culinary, then you can find some subset that the existing players have not touched upon yet. If that is not possible, then you must figure out what you are best at and use that authority to create a niche within a niche.\n\nIt is all about the value you can offer to your audience and how you help, change or enrich their lives.", "score": 0.2003259891682332, "step": 5, "reward": 0.20032599568367004, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.2, "user_reward": 0.2003259891682332, "llm_reward": 0.5928420533310518, "utility": 0.34461815209601104, "reward_gap": 0.3925160641628186, "source": "medium"}

It is almost a meme by now. It is a bit true, but also a lot wrong. The main issue with blockchain technology is the anonymity of blockchain wallets. Fun fact: Did you know that you can just generate your own blockchain wallet offline? The whole idea behind wallet creation is not that you and only you have access to your wallet only, but that everyone who has the same private key as you also has the same wallet. The “security” only stems from one aspect: Stochastics! Two people have a very very low chance to create the same wallet. For example, MetaMask creates them using 2048 seed words. In total, you need 12 of them to create a wallet. Therefore, there are 204⁸¹² possibilities. Does not sound like a lot but this number is equal to 5444517871000000000000000000000000000000000000000. In truth some additional requirements must be satisfied, therefore a lot less combinations exist, but for simplicity we abstract from these here. All of these wallets are therefore entirely anonymous. The only way to know who has access to which address is by creating a mapping between a person’s real identity and the wallet address they have used for a transaction. Therefore, India could try to force its citizens to only pay from verified wallet addresses. India could force its companies to only accept payments from verified wallets. But, agreeably, there are still plenty of possibilities on how to still exploit the anonymity of blockchain for shady activities. There’s one crucial aspect to the blockchain though: It keeps a log of every transaction ever executed forever, redundantly backed up on thousands or even millions of servers worldwide. Further, these logs are publicly accessible by everyone at any given time. Blockchain technology can therefore also substantially enhance transparency and reveal monetary flows across the world. It acts as an ultimate threat: Yes, you can engage in illegal transactions, but should your wallet address ever become traceable back to you, even if only by accident, everyone can see what you’ve done. Therefore, India should not ban “private” (i.e.. “decentralized”) blockchains, but rather embrace them and build systems around them to enhance both their transparency and security.", "score": 0.15941234055554926, "step": 5, "reward": 0.15941233932971954, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.15941234055554926, "llm_reward": 0.5524525125577243, "utility": 0.29676210686780885, "reward_gap": 0.39304017200217506, "source": "medium"}

Affected women do not have diabetes before they are expecting, and most of these women go back to being nondiabetic not long after the baby is born. Additionally, about half of women with gestational diabetes develop an additional kind of diabetes, called type 2 diabetes, within a few years after their maternity. Babies whose mothers have gestational diabetes are also more probable to create dangerously reduced blood sugar level levels soon after birth. Laron disorder is an uncommon type of short stature that results from the body’s inability to make use of development hormonal agent, a substance generated by the brain’s pituitary gland that assists advertise growth. The signs and signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome vary, also among affected members of the exact same family. Studies recommend that people with Laron syndrome have a significantly reduced danger of cancer and type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, people with Laron disorder do not seem to have an enhanced life expectancy compared to their unaffected loved ones. Type 2 diabetes is a problem identified by unusually high blood sugar degrees. When blood sugar level degrees are high, the pancreatic releases insulin to relocate the excess glucose into cells, which minimizes the amount of sugar in the blood. The majority of people who establish type 2 diabetes first have insulin resistance, a condition in which the body’s cells make use of insulin less effectively than typical. Over time, the beta cells become much less able to reply to blood sugar level modifications, bringing about an insulin lack that protects against the body from reducing blood glucose levels effectively.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the text is machine-generated by the Brevi Technologies’ Natural language Generation model, and we do not bear any responsibility.

In this case, the wider community can use this technology.\n\nAs explained by Meta,“Spark AR Go is an iOS app designed to let creators whose first mediums maybe something like photography, memes, art, or video express themselves and their perspectives through AR. Creators will be able to extend their personal brands, assets, and creative vision to fans in new ways — like with custom AR quizzes, unique background replacement, or a one-of-a-kind makeup look.”\n\nSpark AR Go includes built-in templates, switch and slide tools, and other options to make it easier to augment reality, giving artists and even non-artists more opportunities to present their AR photos.\n\nSimilar to Snapchat Lens Studio, Meta hopes to make more people interested in this option by providing a simpler and more efficient augmented reality flow.\n\nYounger users align with the platform that leads the way and moves with the tide. This is in favor of the meta. The question is, can meta attract the young generation’s attention and be liked by them? Because it is the young people who help the meta to progress and become pervasive.\n\nBy opening up their tools to more developers, there is quite a chance that Meta could face the popular AR tools.

Here’s a draft based on the overview you provided earlier:\n\n---\n\n**Title: New Partnership with The Rubbish Project: Driving Circular Economies and Reducing Plastic Waste**\n\nOur collaboration with The Rubbish Project focuses on advancing circular economies, aligning with their mission to minimize waste and promote sustainable practices. Huhtamaki, a leading player in the packaging industry, is also part of this initiative, contributing to a closed-loop system that significantly reduces plastic waste.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe closed-loop system we are implementing is designed to minimize waste and promote sustainability. While we are still finalizing the exact numbers, the system is expected to have a substantial positive impact on reducing plastic waste.\n\n**Follow Us:**\nStay updated with our latest news and initiatives by following us on social media:\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ourcompany)\n- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ourcompany)\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ourcompany)\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need any further adjustments or additional details.", "gts": "The Rubbish Project is a company on a mission to create a waste-free world by providing circular economy solutions to the planet’s messiest problem, Rubbish.\n\nThey work with businesses to create closed loop supply chains, transitioning from a wasteful linear model of consumption to a sustainable circular one. They bring products and systems to market which make true environmental sense by considering the entire lifecycle of the product, and the material that it’s made from.\n\nThe Rubbish Project, has developed a circular economy system, which has been adopted by packing companies including Huhtamaki to expand their sustainable packaging solutions worldwide. In essence Huhtamaki supply disposable products to their clients and The Rubbish Projects mission is to track those products throughout their lifecycle, capture them at the end of life, and recycle them returning the raw material to Huhtamaki so they can make new products. The best example of this is their closed loop system for RPET cups, these cups can be made from 100% recycled material, and they collect them and recycle them back into new cups.\n\n$BEACH understands that as part of the ecosystem, circular economies are required to process all the plastics that we are removing from our beaches and oceans. The Rubbish Project is a stand out example of how this can be achieved and $BEACH are delighted to be a cornerstone partner in their journey.\n\nThe Rubbish Project\n\nVisit The Rubbish Project Socials Below\n\nWebsite: https://therubbishproject.com/\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/rubbishproject?lang=en\n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rubbish-project/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/therubbishproject/\n\nWaste Collection to New Products\n\nVisit $BEACH Socials Below\n\nTelegram Room\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\n\nMedium\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn", "score": 0, "step": 5, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}

The festival, known for its large crowds and high-energy atmosphere, was hosting a concert by the popular band, The Boom Boom. Ezra, who was from Houston, Texas, was excited to see his favorite artist perform.\n\nThe incident occurred during the concert when a structural failure led to the collapse of the roof of the concert venue. The collapse trapped many concertgoers, including Ezra, who was among the victims. Despite the efforts of emergency responders, Ezra was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nEzra's family, devastated by the loss, has filed legal actions against the festival organizers and the venue management. They are seeking justice and compensation for the tragedy that took their son's life.\n\nThe Astroworld Festival tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the importance of safety measures in large-scale events. Authorities are investigating the incident to determine the cause and prevent such tragedies in the future.\n</response>", "gts": "A tenth person has died from injuries suffered at last weekend’s Astroworld Festival. Nine-year-old Ezra Blount passed away Sunday, according to a statement released by his family’s attorney.\n\n“The Blount family tonight is grieving the incomprehensible loss of their precious young son,” the Blount family attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. “This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert, what should have been a joyful celebration. Ezra’s death is absolutely heartbreaking. We are committed to seeking answers and justice for the Blount family. But tonight we stand in solidarity with the family, in grief, and in prayer.”\n\nBlount was sitting on his father’s shoulders during Travis Scott’s headlining set on Friday night when the two suddenly found themselves trapped in a crowd surge. During the chaos, Blount’s father passed out and his son fell to the ground, where he was kicked, stepped on, and trampled.\n\nBlount suffered severe injuries to his liver, kidney, and brain, which caused him to go into cardiac arrest. Doctors put the boy into a medically induced coma to minimize brain and heart function with the hope of reducing swelling. Unfortunately, the boy succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.\n\nPrior to Ezra’s passing, the Blount family filed a lawsuit against Travis Scott and Live Nation, the producers of Astroworld. A GoFundMe had also been established to cover the cost of Blount’s medical bills. As of Sunday evening, the family had raised close to $70,000 in donations.\n\nPolice are investigating the circumstances that led to the crowd surge, which took the lives of nine other people, ranging in age from 14 to 27. Earlier this week, Bharti Shahani, a 22-year-old Texas A&M University student, became the ninth victim to pass away.\n\nTravis Scott has offered to cover funeral costs for all of the victims, and is providing free counseling for those festival-goers impacted by the tragedy.", "score": 0.32320714931244077, "step": 5, "reward": 0.32320713996887207, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.32320714931244077, "llm_reward": 0.3910973288462893, "utility": 0.35553544515296837, "reward_gap": 0.06789017953384852, "source": "medium"}

The shape was cute and popular. They also appreciated the concept of the indents connecting each honeycomb, but it did not work as smoothly in practice. Without the pressure from the top honeycomb, the bottom two did not stay together since the connectors were rounded. Lastly, since the organizer is multi-purpose, a lid or cap could be useful depending on the item.\n\nOverall, this was great practice with 3D modeling software and printers. The actual prototype itself definitely needs more improvements. In the future, I will experiment with different sizes. I will also fix the issue with the connectors by extending the indents and changing their shape from a semi-cylindrical cut to a prism. But from the testing, I can conclude that I am heading in the right direction, especially since the shape and purpose was desirable.", "score": 0.18390245180920395, "step": 5, "reward": 0.18390245735645294, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.2, "user_reward": 0.18390245180920395, "llm_reward": 0.5652858518837012, "utility": 0.3224243386198802, "reward_gap": 0.3813834000744972, "source": "medium"}

One fine name is Esports. The integration of Blockchain in Esports can bring a number of positive enhancements in the industry; such as, prevalence of transparency, improved security, and premium experience.\n\nTransparent Culture\n\nThe most important thing the blockchain technology can bring into eSports is the transparent culture; since no matter how much the gamer is capable enough but there are still limitations to it. Like, we still do not know how many successful gamers exist in this world. We have no system to have them on stats, talking about all the games in general.\n\nWhat blockchain can do to help eSports is that it can help gamers make profile on a decentralized network where all of their records or performance will be available and updated automatically so that sponsors can reach out to them without any barrier.\n\nHigh-End Security\n\nThere is significant amount of security issues in esports. Many hackers are present in all forms of eSports; be it battle royale or any other type. However, all the security concerns can be eliminated, if Blockchain applies its immutable technology into eSports. All the cheating and scams will be eradicated.\n\nBetter Experience\n\nIt would be false to say that eSports is in need of blockchain technology; however, better would be to say that blockchain can enhance gaming before eSports reach another level. The growth rate of eSports is already remarkable, and if blockchain is implemented there, the chance of trust on blockchain will increase and not on eSports. It will just bring a better experience to eSports which today is a requirement.\n\nFuture of Esports in Blockchain\n\nThe future seems bright but it all depends on gaming geeks who are the real ones to make it possible. Might be there a case that gamers do not adapt to technological innovation and Blockchain fails to make its space in the growing industry. Only time will tell what gamers adopt and what not.\n\nWith all of the above things in consideration, there is a recent announcement made by an organization Crypto League Gaming that they will be introducing such portal based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts that will promote transparent culture, high end security, and better experience.", "score": 0.11386422140901468, "step": 5, "reward": 0.1138642206788063, "answer_reward": 0.25, "format_reward": 0.2, "user_reward": 0.11386422140901468, "llm_reward": 0.4782759083504702, "utility": 0.23336348026847636, "reward_gap": 0.3644116869414555, "source": "medium"}

A study conducted by blockchain.com revealed that of the total distribution of 21 million Bitcoins, 18.89 million have already been mined and distributed to the market. The milestone comes almost 12 years after the first block, which consisted of 50 Bitcoins, was dug on January 9, 2009.\n\nBitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto has set the value of Bitcoin at 21 million, making cryptocurrency scarce for controlling inflation that may result from the unlimited supply. Bitcoin is “mined” by miners who solve math problems to verify and validate the transaction block that takes place on its network. It is a process of adding new Bitcoins to the stream. After making a successful transaction set, the miner is rewarded with a Bitcoins block.\n\nIt should be noted that every four years the value of Bitcoin mining is being halved. So, when Nakamoto created Bitcoin, the reward for securing a block of transactions was 50 Bitcoins. In 2012- 25 Bitcoins and dropped to 12.5 in 2016 and by the end of 2024 miners are expected to earn only 1.56 Bitcoins. This process is called splitting and will continue until the last Bitcoin is mined.\n\nIt may seem that the world’s most popular cryptocurrency is on the verge of collapse, but from the halving schedules, it is predicted that the remaining 10 percent of bitcoins will continue until February 2140, according to blockchain.com.\n\nAfter reaching 21 million, Bitcoin will be very scarce and miners will rely on transaction funds, instead of block earnings. Miners will start to earn more from the transactions that take place on these blockchains than the mines themselves.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Bitcoin is not just a cryptocurrency, but a blockchain network that processes transactions in a distributed platform. Therefore, has a lot more to use than just a crypto asset.", "score": 0.15026747424124215, "step": 5, "reward": 0.15026746690273285, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.125, "user_reward": 0.15026747424124215, "llm_reward": 0.4033170417338382, "utility": 0.2461817076465949, "reward_gap": 0.25304956749259605, "source": "medium"}

DareNFT has developed a suite of products to address some of the challenges in the NFT landscape, including unrecognized benefits between NFTs, unrecognized relationships between NFT owners and hidden risks of NFT ownership. There are many content types out there and whereas the content types matter at application level, the licensing protocol layer is the same for all of them. Therefore, there is only one protocol needed to serve all.\n\nThe existing licencing processes of derivative content are mostly manual and time consuming. With an NFT 2.0 smart contract, these processes can be automated. Derivative content such as: song remixes, subtitled videos, edited images, learning contents, translated book often generates revenue from the rental and subscription business model. Creators can receive royalties from reproducer’s revenue via the NFT smart contract. This speeds up collaboration and sharing of benefits between the author and re-publisher, resulting in more income for both parties.\n\nThe advent of the NFT 2.0 protocol that DareNFT proposes can mark a new milestone for nonfungible tokens and the crypto market in general. The platform’s competitive advantage is its ability to adapt to emerging trends, banking on its NFT 2.0 protocol which is an essential element for building a thriving platform.\n\nDareNFT will provide InPoker with the access to its ecosystem and the NFT marketplace where InPoker plans to list some of the Elite NFT membership cards. This long-term partnership marks a significant milestone in InPoker’s efforts to introduce the cutting edge technologies to online gaming.\n\nVisit DareNFT: https://darenft.com/\n\nStay tuned for more exciting developments on https://www.inpoker.io\n\nJoin our official Telegram Channel here: https://t.me/influencerpoker", "score": 0.13782512250433038, "step": 5, "reward": 0.1378251165151596, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.13782512250433038, "llm_reward": 0.3654743663688554, "utility": 0.22443606955429427, "reward_gap": 0.227649243864525, "source": "medium"}

Like many on the market, the Zone Diet is the result of many years of intense study into the way the human body uses the food sources it is given. Through this research, the folks at Zone Diet have managed to find a way to make your body use the food to its fullest advantage and make you lose weight. The Zone Diet is gaining wide spread acceptance as a true form of weight loss and anything but a fad diet.\n\nDr. Sears is the man responsible for the Zone Diet and all of its inner workings. For years he has studied the effects that certain foods have on the bodies fat burning potential. With this research he has found the formula of foods and drinks that actually spur the body into over drive and help it to burn off the unnecessary fat and make you lose weight.\n\nThe Zone Diet is nothing like the other starvation diets that have come down the pike. In most cases you do not have to give up the foods that you love, but simply make adjustments in the daily regimen. This all speaks to the unique way that the Zone Diet works. Instead of cutting out the meals the Zone Diet adds two additional meals to the daily routine.\n\nThe Zone Diet works to stabilize and increase the insulin output of the body. With this insulin the body can more readily burn the fat to make certain that you are losing weight. This diet does not work in miracles or days even. There is a standard amount of time that you will need to work to make sure that you have maintained the proper procedures in the diet. This will help to build the bodies natural defenses against weight gain. With this manner you will be training your body to accept and decline certain foods in order to keep the weight that you lose off.\n\nThe Zone Diet is being actively referred to as the diet of the stars. Many of those in Hollywood and surrounding areas have found that the Zone Diet is vastly superior to the other diets currently on the market and therefore increasing its popularity to new levels.\n\nThis post contains affilliate links.If you use these links to buy something we may earn commission.thanks", "score": 0, "step": 5, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}

Then it must target your personal symptoms, which will have endless permutations of the major and common symptoms. Only this personal approach can come even close to a cure. Everything else is simply suppressing the cause or dealing with the effect.\n\nA cure must, by definition, be temporary treatment. Providing you with the strength to push through and manage on your own.\n\nBefore looking at what natural modalities can achieve this, there is one area of natural health care than has and is also curing diabetes, in animals as well as people.\n\nDiet.\n\nThe old saying of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ couldn’t be more true for health. Eat processed food or a diet which is essentially nutrient poor, and how can you expect your health to be good? Or, to put it another way, if you put diesel in your unleaded vehicle, would you expect it to run at all, let alone well?\n\nWhy is the area of your local supermarket that sells fresh fruit and vegetables quite a small area in comparison with the rest of the store? Because people don’t buy enough! A recent survey came to the worrying conclusion that about 80% of the food bought in a typical western country was processed.\n\nYet a recent study discovered that when people ate a totally raw diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, not only did their diabetes reduce, IT VANISHED COMPLETELY. After this diet for only one month, all the long term users of insulin no longer needed it.\n\nSo diet is essential to your good health and if you have diabetes, this is an area that you must address first, to get any results.\n\nBut let’s go back to the modality of health care that can cure diabetes discussed earlier. The natural and perhaps unique approach which personalises your cause, your symptoms is homeopathy.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is a safe, powerful yet gentle modality of complete and natural health care. Homeopathy is a way of life, rather than a ‘quick fix’ type of health care. By supporting your homeopathic treatment with a natural diet, regular exercise, optimum sleep, natural exposure to the sun on bare skin, time for you, time to relax, you can expect to have the best of health.\n\nYou can, in addition to professional homeopathic help, learn to use the common remedies at home, treating those common injuries and ailments that happen to even the best regulated families.\n\nDo try it once.", "score": 0.1638289910350937, "step": 5, "reward": 0.1638289839029312, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.1638289910350937, "llm_reward": 0.34924896738328337, "utility": 0.23920097396635256, "reward_gap": 0.18541997634818966, "source": "medium"}
{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Hey, can you help me write an article on the pros and cons of having an online business? I want it to be concise, under 500 words.Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Yes, include a short conclusion with 2-3 actionable tips—like time-blocking for work-life balance or budget-friendly tools to reduce startup costs. Keep it snappy so we stay under 500 words.

advantages, but also comes with its disadvantages.\n\nBuilding a successful online business is a dream come true for many people around the world, though to some, it is not always fun and games.\n\nSources have it that you can survive on online businesses and enjoy the freedom of earning real money from your passions.\n\nAs earlier mentioned, running an online business is not always a walk in the park, and therefore it is wise not to underestimate the hard work that a successful online business requires.\n\nTo understand what it entails to run an online business, let us take a look at the Benefits and Costs of running online businesses.\n\nBenefits of Running an Online Business\n\n1) Flexible schedule and rules.\n\nOwning an online job allows you to create your rules and be your boss. With the flexibility that comes with self-employment, one can even create time to see friends and family.\n\n2) Low startup costs.\n\nOne key benefit of owning an online business is the low starting cost. Sources have it that you can start a website with less than $100, and as your business grows, you can invest more in it. An online business gives you the liberty of working from your house and requires no leasing costs. You do not have to worry about an employee’s salary too!\n\n3) You become the boss.\n\nRunning your own online business gives you the mandate of setting the rules and regulations. Nobody tells you what to do, and you get an opportunity of controlling your destiny. You get to make decisions about marketing, product or service development, customer service, and pretty much everything related to your business.\n\nCost of Running an Online Business\n\n1) Long working hours\n\nFor any business to succeed, it calls for hard work and long working hours. Starting an online job from scratch takes a good amount of time to be successful and in some cases, people are required to work on weekends to reach their targets.\n\n2) Requires a lot of discipline.\n\nWith all the freedom that comes with running your own business, discipline is fundamental. The time one takes for breaks should be limited, and more focus should be made to reach the set target.", "score": 0, "step": 5, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}

So planning to furnish the interiors and outdoors involve a bit of exercise and strategy to sort out things properly.\n\nYou can find the relevant information on following some key aspects for purchasing furnishings on an affordable budget through this article with Discount Codes. In this article, let’s take a look at the 6 best ways that work out better for your home.\n\nBasic Needs Come First\n\nPrioritize all the products and make a list. Prepare the needs list first and include the wants later. This helps reduce your budget and if you really have more affordability, you may land in with all the goods. Kitchen table, chairs, beds, couches are the most common requirements for any home.\n\nPay Attention To Seasonal Sales\n\nFurniture Deals seriously help you run through the budget constraints while furnishing your home. Users find few overloaded stock that’s not completely sold at comparatively lower prices while you may be wondering at how the seasonal sales happen.\n\nStore Credit Cards Can Be Helpful\n\nThe perfect use of paying credit in time with 0% interest can be really helpful while the stores themselves help you in providing such zero interest credit cards. But the tricky part lies when you are not paying the credit amount in time. Then the whole amount that’s billed over the furnishings would be charged with an interest.\n\nPlan Perfectly\n\nKeep a close watch on all the spaces at the home you purchase or want to walk-in. Never let a misplacement or shortage of furnishings break the beauty of your home. Plan accordingly and especially in a way that the products including beds, and sofa chairs fit right into the spaces.\n\nPrefer Secondhand Goods\n\nIt’s not possible to afford higher prices for furnishing your home and particularly with all families. So furnishing your home at affordable cost with Sofa Deals and other existing offers is a possibility. This of course happens most of the time when you have no objection towards purchasing the second hand goods.\n\nFix Home Decoration Budget\n\nBeyond going with the lighting & decoration part, an average affordable family can go with the limited styling to the home while the affluent families can go well ahead. Of course decorating a new home is every one’s wish. So, a plan and fixing of a certain budget for decoration and lights is much possible with the Lighting Deals.", "score": 0.28437679398682275, "step": 5, "reward": 0.2843768000602722, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.08749999999999998, "user_reward": 0.28437679398682275, "llm_reward": 0.40113017440977183, "utility": 0.33774563353213904, "reward_gap": 0.11675338042294908, "source": "medium"}

It is essential to note that the library is still under development, and there may be bugs or limitations.

This gesture is usually a long press on touch screens or a click and drag when using a mouse.\n\nA simple drag & drop sample.\n\nWhile Android has long supported drag and drop ( DragEvent was introduced in Android 3.0, API level 11), integrating full support for handling gestures, events, permissions and callbacks has proven to be complex.\n\nToday we’re introducing the Jetpack DragAndDrop library as an alpha release to make it easier for you to handle data dropped into your app.\n\nDrag and drop is becoming increasingly relevant for large screen form factors: tablet and laptops, but especially also foldables, where split screen is used 7 times as often than on conventional phones. The ability to drag data from one app to another is a natural experience for users as they multitask more efficiently with their apps in split-screen or windowed modes.\n\nWhile dragging text from EditTexts is supported natively by the platform, we strongly recommend enabling users to drag any images, files or text from other components of your app. Just as importantly, we encourage allowing users to drop data into your apps as well.\n\nDragging from one app into another.\n\nDropHelper , in combination with DragStartHelper , makes it much easier to take care of gesture support, callbacks, styling and pixel-perfect alignment.\n\nDragStartHelper\n\nDragStartHelper is a utility class in Jetpack core that detects gestures commonly used to start a drag, such as long pressing or click and dragging with a mouse.\n\nDropHelper\n\nThe new DropHelper is a utility class that takes care of listeners and drop targets. Be sure to use addInnerEditTexts() when building DropHelper.Options to ensure that any nested EditTexts inside your drop target don’t acquire focus instead.\n\nLearn more\n\nRead more in the Drag and drop guide on Android Developers, dive into the large screen sample to see DropHelper in practice and then try it out in alpha now to give us feedback.\n\nThanks to Florina, Ben and Nick!", "score": 0.19038802681731296, "step": 5, "reward": 0.190388023853302, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.08749999999999998, "user_reward": 0.19038802681731296, "llm_reward": 0.36194474846562735, "utility": 0.2625070408146407, "reward_gap": 0.1715567216483144, "source": "medium"}

It is almost a meme by now. It is a bit true, but also a lot wrong. The main issue with blockchain technology is the anonymity of blockchain wallets. Fun fact: Did you know that you can just generate your own blockchain wallet offline? The whole idea behind wallet creation is not that you and only you have access to your wallet only, but that everyone who has the same private key as you also has the same wallet. The “security” only stems from one aspect: Stochastics! Two people have a very very low chance to create the same wallet. For example, MetaMask creates them using 2048 seed words. In total, you need 12 of them to create a wallet. Therefore, there are 204⁸¹² possibilities. Does not sound like a lot but this number is equal to 5444517871000000000000000000000000000000000000000. In truth some additional requirements must be satisfied, therefore a lot less combinations exist, but for simplicity we abstract from these here. All of these wallets are therefore entirely anonymous. The only way to know who has access to which address is by creating a mapping between a person’s real identity and the wallet address they have used for a transaction. Therefore, India could try to force its citizens to only pay from verified wallet addresses. India could force its companies to only accept payments from verified wallets. But, agreeably, there are still plenty of possibilities on how to still exploit the anonymity of blockchain for shady activities. There’s one crucial aspect to the blockchain though: It keeps a log of every transaction ever executed forever, redundantly backed up on thousands or even millions of servers worldwide. Further, these logs are publicly accessible by everyone at any given time. Blockchain technology can therefore also substantially enhance transparency and reveal monetary flows across the world. It acts as an ultimate threat: Yes, you can engage in illegal transactions, but should your wallet address ever become traceable back to you, even if only by accident, everyone can see what you’ve done. Therefore, India should not ban “private” (i.e.. “decentralized”) blockchains, but rather embrace them and build systems around them to enhance both their transparency and security.", "score": 0.15941234055554926, "step": 5, "reward": 0.15941233932971954, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.15941234055554926, "llm_reward": 0.5524525125577243, "utility": 0.29676210686780885, "reward_gap": 0.39304017200217506, "source": "medium"}

To help you make the decision easier, remember that people who require cosigners often miss payments and have poor credit. They have a history that depicts poor financial decision-making.\n\nThe reason people need a cosign is because they can’t do it alone without your help; they need you. The question is, are you willing to take a chance on the Detroit Lions, whose record is 2 wins-12 losses-1 tie. I wouldn’t.\n\nYes, we take risks when we make investments, but consigning a loan is not the same thing — it’s entirely different. You’re investing in someone who has already shown you a record of failing financials. In the startup world, this is a major red flag.\n\nChoosing not to help your best friend or sibling get a new car, take out a personal loan, or get a credit card is disheartening — especially if you have the means to help.\n\nWhat happens if they start missing payments? What happens if they decide they can’t make any payments and you’re stuck with the payments?

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Hey, can you help me draft an article about a co-working space in Singapore? The name is Workcentral, located on Orchard Road. I want to highlight its accessibility and the vibe there. Let me know what details you need!Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question.

She highlights the outcomes derived from the said technique creating a win-win situation for all. If you look at most leading indicators for programmatic digital advertising, the trends point steadily upwards with DSP Technology for Middle-market Brands. The latest forecast from eMarketer projects that marketers will spend more dollars on programmatic ($133B), that it will account for a greater share of the media mix (91%), and that a growing and increasingly premium share of available inventory will be transacted programmatically.\n\nIt’s Only Middlemen for The Middle Market — Major brands and agencies have long mastered the ins and outs of programmatic tech. Reading the industry trades, one could easily assume that the vast majority of advertisers have followed suit. The simple reason is that they don’t spend enough money on their own to meet the minimums for leading DSPs like MediaMath and The Trade Desk. These arbitrary minimums have excluded the majority of advertisers from the programmatic advertising technology.\n\nIt’s a lost opportunity for everyone. These budget minimums have limited the middle market’s autonomy and curtailed its ability to bring advertising operations under their own control. They have disincentivized these companies from developing the talent and budgeting the resources necessary to master this technology and get the most value from it. And they have kept the major DSPs from accessing the largest, most diversified, and therefore most durable segment of advertisers. Instead, middle market companies rely on media agencies (like my company, AudienceX) to manage their digital budgets, essentially acting as surrogate operators of this DSP technology. On the surface, that would seem to benefit digital agencies like us, but in the long run I’m not sure it benefits anyone.\n\nFor more such updates, check Out recent Martech Cube guest blogs.", "score": 0.12515901854556563, "step": 5, "reward": 0.12515902519226074, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.12515901854556563, "llm_reward": 0.33812509101343385, "utility": 0.20571680664659228, "reward_gap": 0.21296607246786822, "source": "medium"}

advantages, but also comes with its disadvantages.\n\nBuilding a successful online business is a dream come true for many people around the world, though to some, it is not always fun and games.\n\nSources have it that you can survive on online businesses and enjoy the freedom of earning real money from your passions.\n\nAs earlier mentioned, running an online business is not always a walk in the park, and therefore it is wise not to underestimate the hard work that a successful online business requires.\n\nTo understand what it entails to run an online business, let us take a look at the Benefits and Costs of running online businesses.\n\nBenefits of Running an Online Business\n\n1) Flexible schedule and rules.\n\nOwning an online job allows you to create your rules and be your boss. With the flexibility that comes with self-employment, one can even create time to see friends and family.\n\n2) Low startup costs.\n\nOne key benefit of owning an online business is the low starting cost. Sources have it that you can start a website with less than $100, and as your business grows, you can invest more in it. An online business gives you the liberty of working from your house and requires no leasing costs. You do not have to worry about an employee’s salary too!\n\n3) You become the boss.\n\nRunning your own online business gives you the mandate of setting the rules and regulations. Nobody tells you what to do, and you get an opportunity of controlling your destiny. You get to make decisions about marketing, product or service development, customer service, and pretty much everything related to your business.\n\nCost of Running an Online Business\n\n1) Long working hours\n\nFor any business to succeed, it calls for hard work and long working hours. Starting an online job from scratch takes a good amount of time to be successful and in some cases, people are required to work on weekends to reach their targets.\n\n2) Requires a lot of discipline.\n\nWith all the freedom that comes with running your own business, discipline is fundamental. The time one takes for breaks should be limited, and more focus should be made to reach the set target.", "score": 0, "step": 5, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}

Traditional currencies like El Salvador’s Bitcoin city and China’s crackdowns highlight the need for oversight to mitigate risks. For example, El Salvador’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender has led to significant volatility and economic instability. Similarly, China’s strict regulations on cryptocurrency have stifled innovation and economic growth. These examples underscore the importance of political action to ensure the responsible development and regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n</response>", "gts": "Just a few days ago Hillary Clinton expressed her opinions on cryptocurrency… Spoiler alert, she is not a fan of cryptocurrencies for a variety of reasons. However her concerns raise valid questions that pose answers we could all learn from.\n\nUnderstanding the technology behind crypto is critical to making smarter investment decisions. Become a blockchain ninja today!\n\nTraditional Currencies Will Suffer\n\nOne of Hillary’s main concerns were that cryptocurrency will eventually become too widespread. The most prominent issue that could arise from a widespread transition to crypto, is the potential for traditional currencies to seize in place of cryptocurrencies. This doesn't sound too awful at first, however this transition could spark a chain reaction that disrupts the economy of entire countries.\n\nEconomies Will Suffer\n\nThe problem becomes much more serious, if in theory cryptocurrency effectively becomes the norm putting traditional currencies in the back seat. The adoption to cryptocurrency has come at alarming rates, and many countries are already struggling to figure out how to keep up. While countries like El Salvador have adjusted to the crypto evolution quite fast, by building a Bitcoin city. Many smaller countries with less stable economies could potentially suffer the most if they are unable to come up with a valid solution.\n\nSecurity Concerns\n\nMany people fear that having large portions of a country’s wealth stored in crypto could be a security risk for getting hacked. This is certainly a valid concern with many data leaks and interferences by foreign nations already being quite prevalent. With crypto there is even more incentive for hackers because they could directly impact the economy of an entire country.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is difficult to say which concerns are the most valid, and what issues deserve the most attention. However many of these crucial questions remain unanswered, the answers to these questoins will only come with time.\n\nOne More Thing\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider following me on Twitter: @natexlee.", "score": 0.13801072993454816, "step": 5, "reward": 0.13801072537899017, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.13801072993454816, "llm_reward": 0.38712156399555453, "utility": 0.23114266075398193, "reward_gap": 0.24911083406100637, "source": "medium"}

Users will be able to send and receive USDP, a stablecoin from Paxos.\n\nWhatsApp launches cryptocurrency payment service\n\nAs a reminder, WhatsApp is part of the Meta/Facebook group, so the integration of Novi is not particularly a surprise. The news was announced by Stephane Kasriel, the new CEO of Novi who replaces David Marcus, the latter having announced his departure a few days ago.\n\nThe Novi wallet, was developed in parallel with Diem, the cryptocurrency initially carried by Facebook. But it is the wallet that seems to have taken center stage: it was launched six weeks ago and is based on USDP: a stablecoin from Paxos backed by the dollar. It, too, has changed its name — it was once called PAX.\n\nPayments in USDP directly from conversations\n\nThis is the payment solution that has just been integrated into WhatsApp, for users located in the United States. According to the official website of the project, they can now access the sending of funds directly from the conversation, as if they were sending an attachment.\n\nMoreover, there are no sending or receiving fees, and it is possible to transfer the amount to their bank account. According to the release, payments are sent instantly from one participant to another.\n\nStephane Kasriel confirmed that the functionality would eventually be opened to other countries:\n\n“The Novi pilot is still in its very early stages, so we made the decision to test this new entry point in one country to begin with, and we will expand it once we get feedback from users.”\n\nDiem is fading?\n\nThe shift in the payment service is now particularly visible. The cryptocurrency, which until recently was called Libra, keeps running into limitations. The regulators show their teeth as soon as Diem takes a step in its development, and this despite a calculated distancing from Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nBefore leaving the project, David Marcus had stated that the company intended to offer Diem eventually, and to integrate it with Novi. The choice of Paxos’ USDT had indeed been a way to rely on an existing cryptocurrency, and therefore less likely to trigger an outcry.\n\nBut in reality, Diem seems to be off to a bad start, and one wonders if Meta will finally manage to spread this cryptocurrency, which has been mutating ever since its 2019 launch was announced.", "score": 0, "step": 5, "reward": 0.0, "answer_reward": 0, "format_reward": 0, "user_reward": 0.0, "llm_reward": 0.0, "utility": 0, "reward_gap": 0, "source": "medium"}

If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Let me get more specific.

Here are 3 ways you can generate more sales leads online. 1) E-mail Marketing: Create an email list of people who want to hear from you, and start sending out emails on a regular basis with tips and advice that are relevant to their needs and interests. Just be sure not to abuse their inboxes!\n\n1) LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a great place to network and connect with other professionals. While you can use LinkedIn’s network to find new leads, as a marketing tool, it still leaves something to be desired in terms of ease of use. If you already have a personal profile on LinkedIn, there are a few tricks that you can use to make networking easier. Use these tips to get more out of your time on LinkedIn\n\n2) Google+\n\nWhile many businesses might think of social media as just a place to share pictures and updates, Google+ is so much more. Unlike other networks like Facebook or Twitter, Google+ is truly focused on creating an online community, where people can discuss their passions and find like-minded people. To create your ideal sales leads online, you must create content that’s valuable to these users and connect with them in ways that let them know you care about what they have to say.\n\n3) Facebook\n\nIf you have a Facebook page for your business, it’s a great idea to post frequently so that people stay up-to-date on new promotions or products. People will be more likely to buy from you if they trust that you are always offering new and exciting things, and since Facebook has become one of the most popular social media platforms in recent years, it’s a great way to gain exposure.\n\nGive-Aways For All The Affiliate Marketer:-|| $100 CPA For EVERY Person Who Enrolls In The One Funnel Away Challenge- That means, offering you 100% of the revenue when people upgrade to the challenge after registering.

Ensure it’s under 500 words and clearly explains the light grey box behavior, button logic (one button for both confirming and adding), and the formulas in simple terms. I need this done quickly for a presentation tomorrow.\n\n### Light Grey Box Behavior\nThe light grey box in our system is a visual indicator that helps users understand certain sections of the content. It highlights important information or steps, making it easier for non-technical users to follow along.\n\n### Button Logic\nThere is a single button that serves two purposes: confirming a step or adding a new one. When you click the button, it automatically moves you to the next step. This simplifies the process and ensures that users don’t miss any important information.\n\n### Formulas\nThe formulas used in our system are straightforward and easy to understand. They are designed to be simple and intuitive, so even non-technical users can grasp them quickly.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following these guidelines, we can create a clear and concise article that non-technical users can easily understand. The light grey box and button logic make the process intuitive, while the simple formulas ensure that the content is accessible to everyone.\n</response>", "gts": "Filter on the name\n\nFiltering on the name goes via a controller; the type of filter inherently part of the table view. You only see what matches. To get a match we use a column containing the full name (thus first name and last name put together). The function Lower() is applied to flatten out capitals and the function Find() to check if the string appears in the column. Details on the Find function in this blog. All we need to remember is that in case the position is greater than 0 (>0) the name (partly) exists. The name(s) that fit the search appear and you keep on typing until one full name is left.\n\nConfirm a match\n\nOnce you have a possible match (the find functions outputs a value greater than 1) you should be able to check this guest so it leaves the list of attendees yet to come.\n\nThe formula logic to indicate the match is not complicated, see below.\n\nThe visual trick is to create a canvas formula that shows results and when nothing is found or when the search box is empty, the formula results in a close to invisible light grey box, see below:\n\nHowever, we have to take the logic one step further to make it possible to confirm the presence. We solve the issue by using the same button to confirm the guest and to — if necessary — add a new guest to the list. This goes in two steps:\n\nFirst, we check if there is only one name and if so we start filtering on this name and we use ModifyRows() as you see below.\n\nThe If statement also tells us what to do if there is no match. Please note that the user has to make sure that only one name comes up. Later on in the process, we’ll solve possible human errors by deleting rows that do not contain a first or last name. Below the code to avoid incomplete records.\n\n[DB GuestList].Filter(Firstname.IsBlank() or Lastname.IsBlank()).Formulamap(DeleteRows(CurrentValue))\n\nSo far we have the solution to check a guest. Next we show how to add a guest in case we have no match.\n\nAdd a new guest\n\nAdding a new quest requires we fill out a form or something that looks like a form.

It is amazing how a sentence containing 10 words or so can come out sounding almost like one long word. Is that what English sounds like to people who don’t speak English? It is exceedingly difficult to learn words in another language when you are unable to decipher exactly where one word ends and another begins. This process is made even harder by the fact that most people here fail to pronounce the whole word anyway. There were many words that I was convinced I knew and was using quite frequently. Imagine my dismay when I found out they had whole other syllables on the end of the word. No wonder I had been getting funny looks from people on the street and in restaurants.\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that an actual course was needed or even better, a private tutor of some sort. The only way I was ever going to learn Spanish was by actually sitting down and studying with someone who could answer the myriad of questions that arose every day. Sad isn’t it? Here I sit, living in a Latin American country and I am unable to pick up the language without resorting to private lessons. Some people seem to have an ear for languages and can pick them up simply by listening, too bad I will never be one of those people.\n\nACCESS SPANISH LANGUAGE COURSES RIGHT NOW", "score": 0.13459237703425056, "step": 5, "reward": 0.13459238409996033, "answer_reward": 1.0, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.13459237703425056, "llm_reward": 0.5677121506976835, "utility": 0.2764230956950376, "reward_gap": 0.433119773663433, "source": "medium"}

Increasing physical activity\n\nThe more energy a person expends throughout the day, the more food they require as fuel.\n\nExercise aids in the depletion of glycogen stores in the body. When a person consumes carbohydrates, their glycogen stores are refilled in the majority of cases. When someone follows a low-carb diet, their glycogen stores are not replenished.\n\nIt may take some time for the body to adjust to relying on fat stores rather than glucose. As the body adjusts, a person may become tired.\n\n2. Significantly reducing carbohydrate intake\n\nKetosis occurs when the body is deprived of carbohydrates and must rely on fat for energy instead of sugar.\n\nIf you want to lose weight, lower your risk of heart disease, or maintain and control your blood sugar levels, you should limit your carb intake to 20 grams (g) per day or fewer.\n\nThis is not, however, a fixed figure. Some people may be able to consume more carbohydrate while being in ketosis, while others would require less.\n\n3. Fasting for short periods\n\nFasting, or going without eating for a period of time, can assist in achieving ketosis. Many people can fall into ketosis without eating anything.\n\nA doctor may recommend a lengthier fasting time of between 24 and 48 hours in specific regulated instances. Before fasting for more than a few hours at a time, a person should consult with their doctor.\n\nFat fasting is a different type of fasting.

In many cases, these tools are doing their jobs automatically, enabling you to communicate across borders by using foreign languages with confidence.\n\nAs we live in an interconnected world, the need for translation has increased exponentially. In the last 10 years, the global language services market has seen rapid growth, virtually doubling in size. In 2019, it was evaluated at $49.6 billion and it’s forecasting to reach $56.18 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nHowever, when comparing the number of words translated daily, you would see it grew that from an average rate of just 2.000 words almost fifty years ago to 10.000 words today. This increase is a result of using an extensive range of machine translation software and special tools that are available nowadays. Algorithms and artificial intelligence help to continuously improve machine translation and process quickly large volumes of text.\n\nBut the main question is:\n\nCan Artificial Intelligence replace completely human translation?\n\nWell, the answer is neither simple nor easy. When the text is simple and clear, machine translation services can replace human linguists and provide good translations immediately. But for the complex texts, translation of sensitive data, business communication, and other professional translations, artificial intelligence translation tools are not a good enough alternative to specialized human translators.\n\nBut as many people rely on translation tools, let’s take a closer look at several machine translation services, their benefits, and limitations. This way, you can decide which translation software fits better to your needs, when you should consider professional translation made by a specialized human translator and when you can rely just on the AI.", "score": 0.1383645821851776, "step": 5, "reward": 0.13836458325386047, "answer_reward": 0.5, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.1383645821851776, "llm_reward": 0.3379757186321219, "utility": 0.21624955282559244, "reward_gap": 0.19961113644694428, "source": "medium"}

These are generally repetitive in nature. If all these payments are handled by the cashier and are recorded in the main cash book, the procedure is found to be very cumbersome. The cashier may be overburdened, and the cash book may become very bulky.\n\nTo avoid this, large organizations normally appoint one more cashier (petty cashier) and maintain a separate cash book to record these transactions. Such a cash book maintained by the petty cashier is called a petty cash book in accounting.\n\nThe petty cashier works on the Imprest system. Under this system, a definite sum, say Rs. 2,000 is given to the petty cashier at the start of a particular period. This amount is called the imprest amount. The petty cashier goes on making all small payments out of this imprest amount and when he has spent the substantial portion of the imprest amount say Rs.1,780, he gets reimbursement of the quantity spent from the top cashier.\n\nIn the Petty Cash Book in Accounting payment side (credit) besides the first amount column. Each of the numbers columns is allotted for items of specific payments, which are commonest. The last amount column is designated as ‘Miscellaneous’ followed by a ‘Remarks’ column. In the miscellaneous column, those payments are recorded that a separate column doesn’t exist. In the ‘Remarks’ the character of payment is recorded. At the top of the amount, all amount columns are calculated. The total amount column l shows the entire amount spent and to be reimbursed. On the receipt (debit) side, there’s just one amount column. Columns for the date, voucher number, and particulars are common for both receipts and payments.\n\nPetty Cash Book\n\nFor more details please visit: https://www.manishco.com/petty-cash-book-in-accounting/", "score": 0.12172341569485265, "step": 5, "reward": 0.12172341346740723, "answer_reward": 3.4183954549201974e-182, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.12172341569485265, "llm_reward": 0.1365052288817053, "utility": 0.12890260943708168, "reward_gap": 0.01478181318685265, "source": "medium"}

The choir joined in stomping, singing and swaying in unison.\n\nSeats in the auditorium of Bethel University’s Benson Great Hall filled quickly as people came to watch Bethel’s student choir groups perform songs from the Festival of Christmas Friday morning. Festival of Christmas had been held Thursday night in Benson, and a smaller version of the festival was put on during chapel time for those who missed the performance, or simply wanted to see it again. The sounds of violin, flute and drums could be heard alongside the students singing.

Pizza but made by a robot\n\nPazzi is an autonomous pizzeria in Paris with another location in Serris in the East of Paris. They call themselves the world’s first autonomous restaurant. Customers order on a self order terminal which allows them to customise the exact toppings of the pizza. The robot arms then prepare the dough, add the sauce and toppings, put the pizza in the oven and cut it in front of your eyes. If you also ordered a drink you’ll get that from a vending machine. Opinion: Pazzi is an excitable example of how a human task can be automated. There is a large team behind it, so we expect to see more of these restaurants in the near future.\n\nA not even that simple task is automated by a robot arm, fun to watch Pazzi make Pizza!\n\nNews 2.Click & Collect but cool\n\nDelipop launched a pick up location for groceries in cooperation with Carrefour in October. To use its service, customers have to order groceries in Carrefour Drive and set the Delipop store as the pick up location. Customers can pick up their orders the same day if ordered in the morning or next day if ordered later during the day. Customers get an access code to enter the colourful Delipop pick-up store. Opinion: Delipop aggregates orders and thus operates at significant lower cost compared to ultra-fast deliveries. At the same time the fresh and modern designed pick-up stores can keep up with the coolness-factor of Gorillas.\n\nA hip and cool pick-up store for groceries, we hope to see more of these around Europe’s neighbourhoods.\n\nNews 3. “Almost Just Walk Out” but more practical\n\nCarrefour launched their new, first of its kind, autonomous store “Carrefour Flash 10/10” in Paris at the end of November. Utilising cameras and scales the store tracks the products taken and customers just have to pay — no scanning needed.

If Mike Zimmer lets his team throw on this depleted Bears secondary, the Vikings should be able to put up a whole lot of points through the air. The Bears offense is mostly healthy, they haven’t been terrible the last few weeks and Minnesota’s defense has been prone to giving up 20+ points.\n\nJustin Jefferson Anytime TD scorer (-105)\n\nThis one makes a whole lot of sense given the Bears secondary situation. Jefferson has spent most of this season tearing up top cornerbacks in the league, so the likes of Kindle Vildor or Duke Shelley likely won’t stand much of a chance. Not the greatest value but I like this at near even money.\n\nJustin Fields OVER 203.5 Pass Yards\n\nIf the Vikings are going to move the ball and put up points quickly, the Bears at some point will have to try and keep up.

Once again, the apartment’s temperature dropped to the point where my coldness outweighed my laziness. I got up and walked over to the heater to turn it on. Five minutes later, the apartment got too hot, so I walked over to turn the heater off. This was the process for controlling the temperature in my apartment. Until now.\n\nEnd result: Flipping a switch with an remotely-controlled motor\n\nEnd result: Close-up of motor position toggling switch\n\nThe world is too technologically advanced for me to be getting up from the couch to flip a switch. Surely, there’s a product out there that would solve this problem for me. The closest thing I could find was the SwitchBot, a stand alone box that presses a button. To turn my heater on and off, I would need two SwitchBots, one for each side of the toggle switch. After reading the product reviews, I was unsure if the SwitchBot would even have enough force to press the toggle switch. Ultimately, I decided against spending $60 on an imperfect solution, and to make something bespoke to my heater.\n\nThe heater’s control panel. The STOP/START switch is the one we need to toggle.\n\nI wanted the simplest solution possible, that used as many existing services possible. I learned from past projects that the more custom things are involved, the more there is to maintain.\n\nWhile searching for ideas, I came across this post, which used an internet-connected motor and simple 3D printed attachment to toggle a light switch. This was it! I’d do the same thing, but with a different 3D printed attachment.\n\nI wanted to get started right away.

Here’s a brief article on how Viagra might have benefits beyond treating erectile dysfunction, focusing on the recent study linking it to a lower Alzheimer’s risk:\n\n**Viagra and Alzheimer’s Risk: A Closer Look**\n\nRecent research suggests that Viagra may have benefits beyond treating erectile dysfunction. A study from the Cleveland Clinic found that men who took Viagra had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The follow-up period was 6 years, not 20.\n\n**Biological Theories**\n\nThe study proposes two biological theories to explain this link. First, blood flow: Viagra increases blood flow to the brain, which could help protect against cognitive decline. Second, inflammation: the drug may reduce inflammation in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**Study Limitations**\n\nWhile the study is promising, it has some limitations. It was observational, meaning it cannot prove causation. Additionally, the study only included men, so the findings may not apply to women.\n\nFeel free to expand on these points as needed.\n</response>", "gts": "Viagra could give you a boost beyond the bedroom: Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic in the U.S. established a correlation between Viagra use and reduced risk for Alzheimer’s. Published in Nature Aging, the study found that using Viagra is associated with a 69% reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAlso watch: Dementia: keeping the heart healthy could be beneficial for the brain too\n\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form of age-related dementia, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide and there is currently no effective treatment.\n\nFor the research, experts analysed data from more than 7 million people and used computer modelling to look for drugs that might target areas in dementia.\n\nAfter six years of follow-up, the team found that men on Viagra had a substantially lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease compared to non-users. They also observed that the drug increased brain cell growth.

Here’s a draft:\n\nHolistic dentistry is a philosophy that integrates oral health with overall wellness. At its core, it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a healthy mouth to support the body’s overall health. One key aspect of holistic dentistry is the oral-systemic link, which highlights the connection between oral health and systemic conditions. For example, gum disease has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. By addressing oral health, holistic dentists aim to improve overall health.\n\nIn terms of practical examples, holistic dentistry focuses on using mercury-free fillings, natural materials, and preventive education. Mercury-free fillings are a safer alternative to traditional amalgam fillings, which contain mercury. Natural materials, such as composite resins, are biocompatible and can be used to restore teeth. Preventive education is crucial, as it empowers patients to make informed decisions about their oral health. This includes regular check-ups, proper brushing and flossing techniques, and dietary recommendations to promote a healthy mouth.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, holistic dentistry offers a comprehensive approach to oral health that not only improves the appearance and function of teeth but also supports overall wellness. I hope this gives you a good starting point!\n</response>", "gts": "Holistic dentistry, also referred to as conservative dentistry and biological dentistry is a form of preventive dental care that prioritizes the health and healing of your natural smile. This type of natural dentistry is focused on maintaining the strength and structure of the teeth and gums, by detecting damage early on and providing treatments that take into account your total-body health. In recent years, this type of dentistry has grown in popularity. Many people are attracted to its holistic approach, along with its use of more natural remedies.\n\nDentist explaining holistic dentistry approach to a patient at Northwest Natural Dentistry, Hayden ID\n\nThe Holistic dentist diagnoses and treats conditions like tooth decay, gum disease, tooth infection, enamel degradation, or dry mouth. Instead of focusing on dental cleaning, he offers education to encourage personal oral hygiene.\n\nUnlike general dentists, holistic dentists do not favor the use of fluoride treatments. Instead of using amalgam materials for dental implants, they prefer to use biocompatible” or natural materials as Amalgams contain mercury, which may cause post-placement sensitivity. There is also a risk of bacteria remnants, which may lead to secondary dental surgery.\n\nWhat is Holistic Dentistry?\n\nHolistic dentistry treats oral problems by focusing on all aspects of health including your physical, emotional, and spiritual health. The philosophy behind holistic dentistry is:\n\nNever treat when you can prevent or heal instead\n\nWhen you must treat, provide technical excellence using minimally invasive methods and non-toxic materials\n\nEmploy safeguards to protect against exposure to known toxins, like mercury\n\nUse treatments that stimulate the body’s natural ability to heal\n\nHow Does Holistic Dentistry Support Total-Body Health?\n\nOptimal oral health promotes the health of your entire body. Poor oral health is associated with increased risk for more serious health conditions, including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.\n\nThe holistic dentistry techniques are designed to protect not just your smile, but your whole body! Using top dental tools and technologies to deliver non-toxic, health-based treatments, the dentist can help identify potential dental problems early on.\n\nIf you prefer natural remedies or whole-health treatment for dental care that prioritizes your complete health with safe materials and effective treatments then Holistic dentistry is the right choice for you.", "score": 0.2837507503979804, "step": 5, "reward": 0.2837507426738739, "answer_reward": 0.75, "format_reward": 0.09999999999999999, "user_reward": 0.2837507503979804, "llm_reward": 0.5275977002799713, "utility": 0.3869189105777729, "reward_gap": 0.2438469498819909, "source": "medium"}

Then it must target your personal symptoms, which will have endless permutations of the major and common symptoms. Only this personal approach can come even close to a cure. Everything else is simply suppressing the cause or dealing with the effect.\n\nA cure must, by definition, be temporary treatment. Providing you with the strength to push through and manage on your own.\n\nBefore looking at what natural modalities can achieve this, there is one area of natural health care than has and is also curing diabetes, in animals as well as people.\n\nDiet.\n\nThe old saying of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ couldn’t be more true for health. Eat processed food or a diet which is essentially nutrient poor, and how can you expect your health to be good? Or, to put it another way, if you put diesel in your unleaded vehicle, would you expect it to run at all, let alone well?\n\nWhy is the area of your local supermarket that sells fresh fruit and vegetables quite a small area in comparison with the rest of the store? Because people don’t buy enough! A recent survey came to the worrying conclusion that about 80% of the food bought in a typical western country was processed.\n\nYet a recent study discovered that when people ate a totally raw diet of fresh fruit and vegetables, not only did their diabetes reduce, IT VANISHED COMPLETELY. After this diet for only one month, all the long term users of insulin no longer needed it.\n\nSo diet is essential to your good health and if you have diabetes, this is an area that you must address first, to get any results.\n\nBut let’s go back to the modality of health care that can cure diabetes discussed earlier. The natural and perhaps unique approach which personalises your cause, your symptoms is homeopathy.\n\nHomeopathic treatment is a safe, powerful yet gentle modality of complete and natural health care. Homeopathy is a way of life, rather than a ‘quick fix’ type of health care. By supporting your homeopathic treatment with a natural diet, regular exercise, optimum sleep, natural exposure to the sun on bare skin, time for you, time to relax, you can expect to have the best of health.\n\nYou can, in addition to professional homeopathic help, learn to use the common remedies at home, treating those common injuries and ailments that happen to even the best regulated families.\n\nDo try it once.", "score": 0.11329522613168536, "step": 5, "reward": 0.11329522728919983, "answer_reward": 0.25, "format_reward": 0.07499999999999998, "user_reward": 0.11329522613168536, "llm_reward": 0.24231665151537396, "utility": 0.16569043372780182, "reward_gap": 0.1290214253836886, "source": "medium"}

Insulin is a hormone that helps transport sugar from the blood to the cells in the body.\n\nInsulin allows your body to use the sugar (glucose) in carbohydrates for energy or store glucose for future use. The most important function of insulin in the human body is its interaction with glucose, and thereby it enables the cells in the body to use glucose as energy for daily chores.\n\nThe more glucose in the blood, the more insulin the pancreas secretes. For the glucose in the blood to enter the cells, the pancreas produces insulin, which sends signals to the cells in the body to absorb the sugar into the blood. For people without diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin to remove a sugar called glucose from the blood, into the cells, and use it as energy. However, diabetes affects this process, which is why some diabetics need extra insulin.\n\nBut if someone has diabetes, either the body cannot produce insulin, or insulin does not work properly in the body. If you don’t have enough insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of supplying energy to your body. In the absence of insulin, the body cannot use glucose as energy in cells. This is when you have to consult the diabetes doctors in Kuwait .\n\nThe World Health Organization guidelines recommend human insulin products for patients with type 1 diabetes who need cheap insulin options. Regular Human Insulin is used in conjunction with a proper diet and exercise program to help control high blood sugar levels in diabetic patients.

How do we achieve such long and gorgeous hair? I’ll let you know how.\n\nAfter some time and numerous tests with my hair, including making homemade masks, purchasing chemical treatments, consuming vitamins, and taking tablets, I finally discovered the best remedy for me.\n\nI had long, lovely hair till I chopped it off a year ago. The reason for my action was that I was bored of my sun-damaged, lifeless, damaged, and broken hair, which did not appear to ever come back in the correct state.\n\nSo, to address the situation, I utilized the scissors. My hair was trimmed in a long A-bob side. The style looked great on me, and I felt like a whole new person.\n\nBut the good vibes didn’t last long. After a while, I began to miss my long hair, so I began Googling and clicking on any link on the internet that promised long hair.\n\nThe Best Kept Not-So Secret? Olive Oil!\n\nStay with your head down, for about 4 minutes after applying the olive oil along the length of your hair.

Insulin is a hormone that helps transport sugar from the blood to the cells in the body.\n\nInsulin allows your body to use the sugar (glucose) in carbohydrates for energy or store glucose for future use. The most important function of insulin in the human body is its interaction with glucose, and thereby it enables the cells in the body to use glucose as energy for daily chores.\n\nThe more glucose in the blood, the more insulin the pancreas secretes. For the glucose in the blood to enter the cells, the pancreas produces insulin, which sends signals to the cells in the body to absorb the sugar into the blood. For people without diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin to remove a sugar called glucose from the blood, into the cells, and use it as energy. However, diabetes affects this process, which is why some diabetics need extra insulin.\n\nBut if someone has diabetes, either the body cannot produce insulin, or insulin does not work properly in the body. If you don’t have enough insulin, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of supplying energy to your body. In the absence of insulin, the body cannot use glucose as energy in cells. This is when you have to consult the diabetes doctors in Kuwait .\n\nThe World Health Organization guidelines recommend human insulin products for patients with type 1 diabetes who need cheap insulin options.

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nThe user's initial question isQuestion: Can you help me draft an article about the best commercial properties in Gurgaon? I want to highlight three M3M projects—Sector 113, Sector 66, and Sector 57. Let me know if you need more details!Now you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: I don’t have exact metrics like rental yields or distances, but the reference info includes key connectivity points (e.g., Golf Course Road, metro access) and project descriptions. Let’s focus on individual strengths rather than a comparison—keep it punchy!

The only thing we must keep in mind is that this trick works well if we clean the blender shortly after use, before the dirt is embedded and dries out. It is well known that blenders can be disassembled, hand blenders can be disassembled very easily. This is essential because the part of the blender where the motor remains cannot be washed as such or submerged, it must be cleaned exclusively with a damp cloth. If we do it frequently, it is not complicated at all and makes our blender always looks like new. The main problem when it comes to cleaning is the blades of the bowl blenders.

We recommend fluoride treatments twice a year along with cleanings to keep teeth their strongest.

However, a less commonly occurring example would be the raffling of a yacht owned by Townsend Duryea in 1858, or the raffling of a fine art portrait by the Montclair Art Museum. While lotteries allude to financial epiphanies for their participants, raffles provide for a grounded method of distribution of assets.\n\nKeep a lookout for this space to know how we are forever changing the raffle system.", "score": 0.16872014013004244, "step": 5, "reward": 0.16872014105319977, "answer_reward": 0.25, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.16872014013004244, "llm_reward": 0.46806670891880003, "utility": 0.28102007173685606, "reward_gap": 0.2993465687887576, "source": "medium"}
