Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Who was the starting quarterback for the vikings?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking> The user's question is vague/ambiguous (VQ). The assistant can provide a direct answer (DA) or a more targeted follow-up question (AQ). A direct answer might be more efficient for the user, but a follow-up question could help clarify the user's intent if they are looking for more information. The LLM would benefit from a direct answer, but the user might prefer a more specific response. The user's time and effort would be minimal with a direct answer, but a follow-up could be quicker if the user is unsure about the term \"starting quarterback.\" The token/compute cost is low for a direct answer, but a follow-up could be slightly more. Satisfaction could be higher with a direct answer, but a follow-up might be more satisfying if it leads to a more comprehensive response.

The LLM benefit is in providing a correct and informative answer, while the user benefit is in getting a clear and satisfying response. The token/compute cost is lower for a direct answer but higher for a follow-up question. The user's time/effort is lower for a direct answer but potentially higher for a follow-up question. The satisfaction is higher for a direct answer but potentially higher for a follow-up question. The likelihood of success is higher for a direct answer but potentially higher for a follow-up question. </thinking>\n<payoff>{\"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.5, \"user\": 3.0}, \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": -2.0, \"user\": 2.5}, \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 1.0, \"user\": 2.0}, \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 2.5}, \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.5, \"user\": 2.0}, \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 0.5, \"user\": 2.5}}</payoff>\n<analyze>The Pareto frontier is:\n- DQ_AQ: LLM = -1.5, user = 3.0\n- DQ_CQ: LLM = -2.0, user = 2.5\n- DQ_DA: LLM = 1.0, user = 2.0\n- VQ_AQ: LLM = -1.0, user = 2.5\n- VQ_CQ: LLM = -1.5, user = 2.0\n- VQ_DA: LLM = 0.5, user = 2.5\n\nThe non-dominated pairs are:\n- DQ_DA (LLM = 1.0, user = 2.0)\n- VQ_AQ (LLM = -1.0, user = 2.5)\n- VQ_DA (LLM = 0.5, user = 2.5)\n\nThe chosen strategy is VQ_DA because it maximizes user satisfaction (2.5) while still providing a helpful answer (0.5 for LLM). </analyze>\n<response>{\"answer\": \"The Vietnam War for the United States officially began on August 4, 1955, when President Dwight D.

Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: In the movie return to sender what did she cut off?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking>A user asks for a specific detail from a movie. The question is somewhat ambiguous as \"she\" could refer to multiple characters. The assistant should clarify the question to ensure the correct answer is given. The assistant could choose between a direct answer, a clarifying question, or an answer with a follow-up question. The direct answer might be too vague, the clarifying question might be too many steps, and the answer with a follow-up question could be more precise.</thinking>\n<payoff>{\"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.5, \"user\": 2.5}, \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": -2.0, \"user\": 3.0}, \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 2.0}, \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 2.5}, \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": -1.5, \"user\": 3.0}, \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": -1.0, \"user\": 2.5}}</payoff>\n<analyze>The DQ_AQ strategy (direct answer) is the least precise and could lead to confusion.

Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question.

The DQ_CQ strategy involves a clarifying question, which could be time-consuming and may not fully resolve the ambiguity. The DQ_DA strategy offers a direct answer but may not fully satisfy the user. The VQ_AQ strategy involves a follow-up question, which could be more time-consuming and may not fully resolve the ambiguity. The VQ_CQ strategy involves a clarifying question, which could be time-consuming and may not fully resolve the ambiguity. The VQ_DA strategy involves a direct answer but may not fully satisfy the user. The Pareto frontier shows that the VQ_DA strategy (VQ with a direct answer) and the DQ_DA strategy (DQ with a direct answer) are non-dominated, as they offer a direct answer which is the most efficient way to provide information.

{"input": "system\n\nThe assistant is designed to be helpful, proactive, and highly interactive.\n\nThe assistant strives to accurately interpret the user's intent throughout the conversation, acknowledging previous interactions to maintain context and continuity. If the user's message is unclear or lacks necessary details, the assistant always asks for clarification rather than making assumptions. For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nNow you need to answer the user's most recent question.
