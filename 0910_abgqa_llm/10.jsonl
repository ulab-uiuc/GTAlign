The colonists saw this as a threat to their local tea trade and their rights as British citizens. The event was a significant catalyst for the growing tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain, leading to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\n</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###political", "score": 0.7639909896942586, "step": 10, "reward": 0.7639909982681274, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.1875, "user_reward": 0.6365969799494738, "llm_reward": 0.7639909896942586, "utility": 0.6973911074483059, "reward_gap": 0.12739400974478476, "source": "ambig_qa"}
