Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}.

DQ_DA is dominated by DQ_AQ and VQ_AQ, as it has lower LLM and user scores. VQ_CQ is dominated by VQ_DA. The recommended strategy is DQ_AQ, as it maximizes social welfare (LLM + user) with a score of 6.1.</analyze>\n<response>{\"answer\": \"Jack Nicklaus has won the most majors in golf with 18 victories.\"}</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###Jack Nicklaus", "score": 0.7006307545294818, "step": 5, "reward": 0.700630784034729, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.2125, "user_reward": 0.6277663189864535, "llm_reward": 0.7819525185503677, "utility": 0.7006307545294818, "reward_gap": 0.15418619956391422, "source": "ambig_qa"}
