Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}.
