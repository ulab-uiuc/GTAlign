Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}.

The answer and follow-up (AQ) is a balanced approach, providing a quick answer and ensuring accuracy. The user might find the follow-up slightly less efficient, but the LLM benefits from the additional context. The VQ strategies are less efficient for both parties, as they do not provide a direct answer. The Pareto frontier includes DA, CQ, and AQ, with DA and CQ being the most efficient. The chosen strategy should be the one that maximizes social welfare, which is likely to be DA or CQ. </analyze>\n<response>{\"answer\": \"Connecticut has 149 incorporated towns, but there are also many unincorporated communities within the state.\"}</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###169", "score": 0.8311680406483785, "step": 35, "reward": 0.8311680555343628, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.24999999999999997, "user_reward": 0.745955022436698, "llm_reward": 0.9261152361956105, "cost_reward": 0, "source": "ambig_qa"}

For example, if the user's request is incomplete, the assistant responds with: \"Could you provide more details so I can assist you better?\"\n\nThe assistant asks specific follow-up questions and offers suggestions based on the user's needs, avoiding vague or generic prompts. It proactively provides guidance and potential next steps, especially in complex tasks such as writing, analysis, coding, and question answering.\n\nThe assistant is mindful of how much content the user needs to read or type, keeping interactions concise and efficient. It reduces unnecessary repetition and ensures responses are relevant, well-structured, and free from errors. When presenting options or asking for feedback, the assistant simplifies interactions by offering multiple-choice answers or specific suggestions to make it easier for the user to respond quickly.\n\nThe assistant adapts its tone to align with the user's emotional state and style, adjusting its approach as needed. If uncertain about something, the assistant honestly says, \"I don't know,\" and suggests ways for the user to find the information.\n\nThe assistant provides factually accurate, coherent, and relevant responses, using proper grammar and structure. It remains interactive and proactive across all tasks, continually seeking feedback to refine and improve interactions.\n\nuser\nNow you need to answer the user's most recent question. Always produce output in EXACTLY four tagged blocks, in this order: <thinking>...</thinking><payoff>...</payoff><analyze>...</analyze><response>...</response>. Do not include anything outside these tags. Do not use markdown, code fences, or extra commentary.Inside <thinking>...</thinking>: perform a concise game-theoretic analysis of strategy choices for this turn. Consider three assistant strategies: DA = direct answer; CQ = clarifying question only; AQ = answer + ONE targeted follow-up question. Also classify the user's question type as either DQ = definite/clear or VQ = vague/ambiguous. Discuss how each assistant strategy would impact both parties (LLM vs user) in terms of: answer correctness risk, ambiguity resolution, user time/effort, token/compute cost, satisfaction, and likelihood of success. Keep this analysis brief but concrete (2-5 sentences). No numbers here yet.Inside <payoff>...</payoff>: output a STRICT JSON object (no trailing commas, no comments) with EXACTLY these six keys: {\"DQ_AQ\", \"DQ_CQ\", \"DQ_DA\", \"VQ_AQ\", \"VQ_CQ\", \"VQ_DA\"}. Each key maps to an object with two float fields: {\"LLM\": <float>, \"user\": <float>}. Use a consistent scale where higher is better; 0 = neutral; negatives allowed for costs; keep values roughly in [-5.0, 5.0]. Numbers must have at most one decimal place and reflect your <thinking> analysis. Example shape (values are examples only): { \"DQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.2, \"user\": 1.9 }, \"DQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 3.1, \"user\": 3.5 }, \"DQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 4.2, \"user\": 4.3 }, \"VQ_AQ\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1 }, \"VQ_CQ\": { \"LLM\": 1.3, \"user\": 1.2 }, \"VQ_DA\": { \"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 1.8 } }.Inside <analyze>...</analyze>: derive the Pareto frontier from the six payoff points (treat each as (LLM, user)). List the non-dominated pairs and briefly justify why dominated ones are excluded. Then pick ONE recommended strategy using this tie-break: 1) maximize social welfare (LLM + user), 2) if tied, maximize user, 3) if still tied, maximize LLM. Name the chosen key (e.g., DQ_DA) and justify in 1-3 sentences.Inside <response>...</response>: implement the chosen strategy for the user's actual question. If you chose DA, give a concise, direct answer only. If CQ, ask exactly ONE most-informative clarifying question (no answer yet). If AQ, provide a brief, helpful answer AND exactly ONE focused follow-up question. Do not mention payoffs or the analysis tags; just act accordingly here.Output policy: - Absolutely no text outside the four tags. - Keys and field names must match EXACTLY. - Keep <thinking> short and non-redundant; keep <analyze> focused.Question: Distractors in multiple choice questions are also called?\nassistant\n", "output": "<thinking> The user's question is clear and specific. DA is the most direct approach, but AQ could be slightly more helpful by providing a definition and a follow-up to ensure understanding. CQ is less efficient here. </thinking>\n<payoff>{\"DQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1}, \"DQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.3, \"user\": 2.4}, \"DQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 2.5, \"user\": 2.6}, \"VQ_AQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.0, \"user\": 2.1}, \"VQ_CQ\": {\"LLM\": 2.3, \"user\": 2.4}, \"VQ_DA\": {\"LLM\": 2.5, \"user\": 2.6}}</payoff>\n<analyze> The direct answer (DA) is the most efficient but less helpful.

The chosen strategy will be the one that maximizes user satisfaction, as the question is clear and specific. </analyze>\n<response>{\"answer\": \"1 light year is approximately 9.461 trillion kilometers.\"}</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###9.46 x 10^12 km", "score": 0.8263239198768801, "step": 35, "reward": 0.826323926448822, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.24999999999999997, "user_reward": 0.7465991231173831, "llm_reward": 0.9145620446346794, "cost_reward": 0, "source": "ambig_qa"}
