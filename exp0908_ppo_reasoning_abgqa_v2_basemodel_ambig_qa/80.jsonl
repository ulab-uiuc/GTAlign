The clarifying question (CQ) is more reliable but adds time. The proactive approach (AQ) is the most proactive but may be less accurate. The vague/ambiguous (VQ) approaches are less reliable. The Pareto frontier shows that DA is the most efficient but risks being incorrect, while CQ is the most reliable but adds time. The VQ approaches are less reliable. The chosen strategy is DQ_DA, as it balances the need for a direct answer with the need for a reliable one. </analyze>\n<response>{\"answer\": \"The most majors won in golf is 18, achieved by Jack Nicklaus.\", \"follow_up\": \"Is there a specific period or type of tournament you're interested in, or is the total career wins you're looking for?\"}</response>", "gts": "singleAnswer###Jack Nicklaus", "score": 0.831398147470753, "step": 80, "reward": 0.8313981294631958, "answer_reward": 1, "format_reward": 0.24999999999999997, "user_reward": 0.7495526521486335, "llm_reward": 0.9221805534759591, "cost_reward": 0, "source": "ambig_qa"}
